Amidar (c) 1981 Konami.

Amidar is an abstract arcade game in which players must 'colour in' all of the rectangles on the screen. Each level has a number of patrolling enemies called 'Amidars' that must be avoided but players are aided in their task with the inclusion of a JUMP button which, when used, causes all the on-screen enemies to jump, giving the player time to escape. There are only three 'jumps' given per level, however.

On odd-numbered levels, the player's character is a gorilla who eats coconuts; on even-numbered levels, it's a paint roller. The game's enemy Amidars are savages and pigs respectively. Whenever a rectangular portion of the board is cleared (either by collecting all surrounding coconuts, or painting all surrounding edges), the rectangle is coloured in and on the even levels, bonus points are awarded, while on the odd-numbered levels, points are awarded for each coconut eaten. 

If players manage to fill in all four corner rectangles of a board, they are briefly able to kill the enemies by touching them (similar to the 'Power-pill' from Namco's Pac-Man series). Enemies killed in this way fall to the bottom of the screen and recover after a few seconds.

On the even-numbered paint roller levels, the roller cannot move too far from grid rectangles that have already been filled without running out of paint and having to return to completed parts of the map to refresh its supply. When this happens, any painted lines that are not part of a filled rectangle will vanish and must be painted again. This means that the player must build their completed squares around the starting point of the level and spread outwards, rather than completing squares on any part of the board as they can on the odd-numbered Gorilla levels. This makes filling in the corner rectangles to become invincible much more difficult.

In between levels players are given the possibility of earning 5,000 bonus points. Here, an Amidar moves across the top of the screen, by pushing the jump button the Amidar traces a random path down towards the bottom of the screen. If the Amidar reaches a bunch of bananas, a bonus is awarded.

- TRIVIA -

Amidar was released in October 1981 in Japan.

The word Amidar comes from Amidakuji, a Japanese classic method of lottery that looks like ladders. It is designed to create random pairings of arbitrary numbers of two sets of start points and goals, each with an equal number of elements.

Todd Lamb holds the official record for this game with 19,225,030 points.

- UPDATES -

Japanese version: Worse attract mode and does not display the number of jumps left. Also higher scoring (20 points per coconut/segment).

- SCORING -

Collecting a coconut or painting a segment: 10 points.
Filling in a box with the paintbrush: the score in the centre of the box - 100 to 700 points.
Killing the Amidars and Tracer after filling in the corner boxes: 100 points, 200 points, 400 points, 800 points, 1,600 points, etc. 3,200 is the maximum on later levels (only in the Japanese version).
Collecting the bonus banana on the interim level: 5,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The Tracer always follows the outside edge and is easy to avoid. Try to ensure it is within range when you complete the fourth corner box of the maze, making it easy to kill.

* The Amidars all have a set movement pattern, which is detailed by the 'Amidar movement' on the title screen. They only move in 4 ways:
a) up/right
b) up/left
c) down/right
d) down/left.
They will follow their current pattern of movement (a, b, c or d) until they reach the edge of the maze when they move round the edge of the last box they contact and continue with their new pattern. e.g. Up/right to the top right of the maze, round the last box and then down/left to the bottom left corner. Mastering their pattern of movement is the key to success!

* If all Amidars are close to the bottom of the screen on the coconuts level, they will take a while to make it to the top. Use this time to clear as much of the top area as you can.

* Remember you have three jumps available on each level so make use of them to get yourself out of a tight corner. Two quick jumps if used in succession will easily give you enough time to get well clear of any danger.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 30 years ago:

Ast√©rix (c) 1992 Konami Company, Limited.

Asterix is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players and is based on the French comic-book series, 'Asterix &amp; Obelix'. Players fight as either Asterix the Gaul or his best friend, Obelix, as they take on the might of the oppressive Roman Empire. 

Asterix and Obelix each have standard jump/attack controls, as well as a dash attack activated by tapping the joystick forward twice then pressing the attack button. Each character also possesses a powerful spinning arm attack, this is activated by holding the attack button for a short while until the character's face turns red, after which players must release the button. If the button is held down for too long, the character gets out of breath and takes a few seconds to recover.

The heroes' main foes are Roman legionaries and fat - occasionally horseback riding - centurions. After an enemy has been beaten enough to fall to the ground, he can be picked up and attacked again, the nature of the attack is dependent on which character picks them up; Asterix will spin the stunned enemy above his head, whereas Obelix smashes him repeatedly into the ground. These stunned enemies also act as temporary weapons, as they will cause damage to any other enemies they come into contact with.

Occasionally, a beautiful blonde lady called Panacea appears carrying a basket. If Asterix or Obelix walk up to her, she will give them a kiss, restoring some health and temporarily paralyzing any on-screen legionaries with embarrassment. Health can also be replenished by picking up the piles of red apples that litter the stages.

Asterix features eight different stages, called 'acts', all with a boss fight at the end. Every act from the second one onwards is based on a different book from the Asterix series and contains signature locations, objects and themed enemies, including pirates, thieves and Indian guards. 

Bonus levels appear after certain stages, featuring either a timed chariot race, or a timed barrel-smashing sequence on board a sailing ship. The game's eight different stages are:
* First Act: Village
* Act 2: Asterix in Egypt
* Act 3: Asterix in Britain
* Act 4: Asterix and the Admirable Panacea
* Act 5: Asterix in Spain
* Act 6: Asterix and the Magic Carpet
* Act 7: Asterix Vs Caesar

- TRIVIA -

Asterix was released in May 1992.

The rock that Obelix carries on his back is called a menhir. It was used in many ancient religious rituals in places like Carnac in the French province of Brittany, particularly during the time of 2000 to 1500 B.C.

King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.5 - KICA-7605) on September 26, 1992.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Tip: When playing as Obelix, the character starts each stage carrying his big rock. Try to hit as many Romans as possible before Obelix throws it away. Any Romans driven away with the rock will drop their helmets on the ground, these can be picked up by the player to earn bonus points.

* Drinking the magic potion (Asterix) or eating a roast (Obelix) will make the respective character invincible for several seconds, allowing them to plow through the Romans, causing the embarrassed Legionnaires to drop their helmets before running away.

Battle of Atlantis (c) 1981 Game World.

Your mission: Finish the six tables at all costs by eliminating a maximum of opponents. To Do this you possess a multi-directional laser (ultra-rapid firing) and terrifying torpedo-bombs. Through all 6 tables, build up your bonus by blowing-up the fuel tanks.
Table 1: Avoid and destroy the floating mines.
Table 2: The deadly exploding sharks appear as well as the destroyers (avoid their bombs!). Obliterate them with your laser.
Table 3: You penetrate into an abyssal cavern where redoubtable octopuses lie in wait. The destroyers can only drop their bombs through the thin sides of the cavern.
Table 4: A complex of towers replaces the lower part of the cavern. As well as the destroyers and octopus, the mines reappear in large numbers.
Table 5: Accelerated version of Table 4.
Table 6: You return to Table 1 in an accelerated version but you must face up to all your opponents.

Berzerk (c) 1980 Stern Electronics.

The player controls the 'Humanoid' and must navigate a number of robot-filled rooms; each with up to as many as eleven, laser-firing enemy robots. The Humanoid can be killed either by a single shot from a robot, by running into a robot, by running into a wall of the maze, or by being touched by the player's nemesis, 'Evil Otto'.

To advance through the game, players must fight their way through each room to an opening at one of the far walls. Each robot destroyed is worth 50 points and while it's possible to progress without killing every robot in each room, destroying all of them will earn the player a per-maze bonus (worth ten points per robot). The game has an impressive 64,000 mazes, with each level designed to be more difficult than the last.

The Berzerk cabinet was the first in a series of cabinets from Stern that had a patented pull out drawer that allowed access to the games circuit boards from the front of the cabinet. This title features rather primitive painted side-art that only uses two colors, but it makes up for it with the awesome comic book style art on the control panel and monitor bezel. The marquee is only a 'Berzerk' logo, and it kind of looks like something that someone might have done in their high school airbrush class.

Berzerk is technically a monochrome game. It uses a special 'color overlay' circuit board to add color to the games graphics before they go to the monitor. A side effect of this is that walking very close to a wall will cause that section of the wall to change to your color.

Berzerk, in common with other machines commonly thought to have used samples (such as Atari's "Star Wars", "Paperboy" and "Gauntlet") used LPC encoded speech and a dedicated speech synthesizer. So the speech is technically encoded data for this speech synth, rather than the now far simpler, digitized audio 'samples' for play back via a DAC.

Here is all of the robots' speech in the game:

During certain in-game events:
"Coin detected in pocket!" - heard randomly during attract mode, especially while showing the high score list.
"Intruder alert! Intruder alert!" - when Evil Otto appears.
"The Humanoid must not escape!" OR "The intruder must not escape!" - when the Humanoid escapes the room after destroying every robot.
"Chicken! Fight like a robot!" - when the Humanoid escapes the room without destroying every robot first.
"Got the Humanoid! Got the intruder!" - when the Humanoid is killed. ("Got the intruder!" is a minor third higher in pitch than "Got the Humanoid!")

Random chatter during gameplay:
"Charge...", "Attack...", "Shoot...", "Kill...", "Destroy...", OR "Get...", followed by "the Humanoid", "the intruder", "it", or "the chicken".
NOTE: In this case, you'll only hear "the chicken" if you escaped the previous maze without first destroying every robot, resulting in the "Chicken! Fight like a robot!" message.

The speed and pitch of some of the phrases vary from deep and slow to high and fast.

Main CPU: Zilog Z80
Sound Chips: Custom tone generator, custom LPC speech synthesis chip

Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 1 (FIRE)

- TRIVIA -

Berzerk was released on November 12, 1980 in the USA.

Alan McNeil, an employee of Universal Research Laboratories (a division of Stern Electronics), had a dream one night involving a black-and-white video game in which he had to fight robots. This dream, with heavy borrowing from the BASIC game 'Robots' ('Daleks' in the UK), was the basis for Berzerk. The idea for a black-and-white game was abandoned when the color game "Defender" was released earlier the same year to significant success. At that point Stern decided to use a color overlay board for Berzerk. A quick conversion was made, and all but the earliest versions of the game shipped with a color CRT display. The game was test-marketed successfully at a Chicago singles bar before general release.

The title of the game comes from the series of books called 'The Berzerker Stories' by Fred Saberhagen. It's a novel about robots which go Berzerk and kill everybody.

Berzerk is the first robot killing game but the big selling point of Berzerk was speech.
From Tony Miller: "The speech was done using LPC coding that I believe was invented by T.I., although I remember we used a National Speech chip in it.  This was when speech and memory was expensive, so we didn't just digitize sounds and dump them out through a DAC. I remember it cost something like $1,000 per word to have the compression done, so we tried to come up with a limited vocabulary which could be rearranged and reused as much as possible. There was some guy up in Silicon Gulch who did this stuff for a living - so it is possible to make money while talking in a monotone.".

The Artist Richard D. James, using his alter ego Caustic Window, has the sample: 'Humanoid must not escape' from this game in his song with the same name as the sample. It's from the album 'Caustic Window Compilation'.

Berzerk was also the first game to attempt a bit of on-screen comedy. Your robot opponents often fell foul of slapstick misfortune, shooting each other in the head or walking into walls and exploding in their attempts to kill you. And if you legged it out of a room without killing them all, the survivors would taunt you in their Speak &amp; Spell voices: "Chicken! Fight like a robot!". Okay, it's not hilarious, but even Bob Monkhouse had to start somewhere. Sometimes when you escape as above, it will just utter "Chicken".

'Evil Otto' was named for 'Dave Otto', who worked for Dave Nutting's Arcade Engineering group as R &amp; D director at the time Alan McNeil did. 'Evil Otto' can be considered one of the most intimidating video game villains of all time. He is, and even travels through walls, preventing a player from loafing in the room. He resembles a bouncing smiley face, and has been called a 'Malicious basketball' by some.

Berzerk was Stern's first major video game success. It was made in both upright (approx. 37,500 units) and cocktail (approx. 1,200 units) models. Berzerk suffered a bit in sales due to frequent breakdowns of it's original giant sized optical 8-way joystick. Approximately 4,200 orders were canceled by distributors and operators whose machines were frequently down from the opto-stick. Stern issued free WICO leaf switch sticks to operators after they had so much trouble with the optical stick, but this still hurt sales.

Berzerk shares a rather chilling distinction of being the first known game to be blamed for an actual player's death. In January 1981, Jeff Dailey was the first person to die playing a video game, a 19-year old Berzerk player, died of a massive heart attack right after playing his favorite game. His score was 16,660 (a very respectable score but disturbing for obvious reasons). On an equally distressing note, in October 1982 at the 'Friar Tuck Game Room' in Calumet City, Illinois: 18-year old Peter Burkowski, a physically healthy person who was alcohol-free and drug-free, inscribed his initials in Berzerk's top ten list twice in a matter of only 15 minutes. A few seconds after that, he collapsed and died of a heart attack.
In Retrogamer Issue #47, Alan McNeil addressed these legends, and has a different perspective: "...one player did die while playing the game (Alan refutes reports that claim two died). The unfortunate fellow was obese and had run upstairs to play the game", Alan explains: "The legend is he set a high score and died, but the owner of the arcade said he didn‚Äôt finish the game ‚Äì he was out of breath from the moment he arrived until he dropped. The legend is way better than reality: the excitement of playing a game killing a player after setting a high score..."

Steve Wagner holds the official record for this game on the 'Fast Bullets' setting with 350,340 points on March 12, 2009.
Phil Younger holds the official record for this game on the 'Slow Bullets' setting with 304,570 points on August 12, 2007.

A Berzerk unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

A Berzerk unit appears in the ZZ Top music video 'Legs'.

Milton Bradley (MB) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1983. 'Can You Survive the Frenzied Attack of the Robot Army?' In this board game version, two players face off. One player controls the Humanoid and the other player controls Evil Otto and the robots. Players alternate sides for a maximum of three rounds or until both have been zapped three times and destroyed as the Humanoid. Humanoid lives are represented by chips placed in front of the player. Each time a player's Humanoid is zapped, the player surrenders one chip. Once a player loses all three chips, that player's Humanoid is destroyed, and therefore he/she cannot control the Humanoid for the rest of the game. The object of the game is to zap more robots while controlling the Humanoid than your opponent.

Berzerk inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Goin' Berzerk' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album, here are the full lyrics!:

Verse 1: (Humanoid - This is me.)
I can move in eight directions.
Once I start I'm never done.
I can go from room to room
I can crawl or I can run.
I can wander through the maze.
It's a wonderland at night
I can stop and aim my gun when
there's a robot in my sight.
I can wander through the maze.
It's a wonderland at night
I can stop and aim my gun when
there's a robot in my sight.

Chorus: (Robots - The various colored robots.)
I think I'm going berzerk.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I'm getting lost in the shuffle.
It happens every time.
I think I'm going berzerk.
Would you like to come to?
I can't stop now - I'm addicted!
I'm berzerk over you.

Verse 2: (Evil Otto - The bouncing smiley face.)
If we fight this thing together
there's a chance that we might win.
Now here comes Evil Otto
push the fire buttons in.
I'm sure he's crazy too because, 
he's bouncing off the floor.
There's no way to destroy him
let him bounce right out the door.
Now here comes Evil Otto
push the fire buttons in.
If we fight this thing together
there's a chance that we might win.

(Repeat chorus)

Berzerk, berzerk, berzerk over you (3x)
Berzerk, berzerk over you.

(Repeat and fade)

The speech, 'Humanoid' and 'Intruder Alert!' featured heavily in 1988's seminal UK Acid track, 'Stakker Humanoid' by later Future Sound of London member Brian Dougans. His use of distortion and slightly lower pitch, leaves the game sounding quite tame by comparison...

- UPDATES -

Two different versions of the game were released. As a player's score increases, the colors of the enemy robots change, and the robots can have more bullets on the screen at the same time (once they reach the limit, they cannot fire again until one or more of their bullets detonates; the limit applies to the robots as a group, not as individuals). In the original version, the sequence goes:
* Yellow robots that don't fire
* Red robots that can fire one bullet
* Light blue robots that can fire two bullets
After 5,000 points Evil Otto doubles his speed, moving as fast as the player while robots remain in the maze, and twice as fast as the player after all the robots are destroyed.

The revised version, which had the much larger production run of the two, features a longer color sequence that also included green, purple, gray, and white robots. In this version, the robot sequence went up to five normal speed bullets, then they began firing fast bullets, starting with one fast bullet, and eventually going as high as five bullets, both normal speed and fast speed, at once. After 19,000 points the robots stay light blue and may have up to five bullets on screen for the remainder of play. To balance the greatly increased threat from the robots in this version, Evil Otto's pursuit speed remains at its normal (half or equal the player's speed) level throughout.

- SCORING -

You get 50 points per robot destroyed. It doesn't matter whether you destroy them or they get destroyed some other way.

You get a bonus of 10 times the number of robots in a maze if you clear it For example, if you destroyed all 7 robots in a maze, then your bonus would be 10 X 7 or 70 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Here is how the rounds progress in the revised version: 
Points - Robot Color - Shots fired 
0-260 - Yellow - 0
260-1,200 - Red - 1
1,200-3,000 - Light Blue - 2
3,000-4,500 - Green - 3
4,500-6,000 - Purple - 4
6,000-8,000 - Yellow - 5
8,000-10,000 - White - One fast shot (2x speed)
10,000-11,000 - Light Blue - Two fast shots
11,000-13,000 - Purple - Three shots, both normal and fast
13,000-15,000 - Gray - Four shots, both normal and fast
15,000-17,000 - Yellow - Five shots, both normal and fast
17,000-19,000 - Red - Five shots, both normal and fast
19,000+ - Light Blue - Five shots, both normal and fast

Starting at about 10,000 points, Berzerk becomes largely a game of luck. If you get an open maze with a lot of robots, there is not much you can do.

* In a 1-player game, the Humanoid is always colored green.

* In a 2-player game, the players alternate turns. The Humanoid's color indicates whose turn it is - green for player 1, purple for player 2.

* When you start the game, the Humanoid will be put at the left entrance. (In a 2-player game, player 2's Humanoid will be put at the right entrance.) You will face anywhere from 1 to 11 robots. Quickly assess where the Humanoid is at and destroy the closest robots. The first 3 sets of robots are pretty easy. It's when they start firing those 3+ shots at you or the supershots things can get bad.

* Remember, the Humanoid is longer then he is wide; use this to your advantage. Always try to exit the maze from the left or right exit so that the Humanoid presents a small profile for the next maze. If the Humanoid enters from the top or bottom, you presents a bigger target. Of course, there is no defense against being put right next to a robot.

* There is a 1-2 second delay after you enter a maze before the robots come after you; use that to your advantage. 

* You cannot run and shoot at the same time in this game. You have to stop and shoot. Use the joystick to aim and press the FIRE button. The Humanoid may move a little in that direction so don't try to shoot robots point-blank or you will destroy the robot while the robot vaporizes you.

* When you get into the later rounds, luck will be as much a factor as skill. This is especially true when the robots are firing supershots at you (these shots travel twice the speed of normal shots). 

* Evil Otto (the bouncing happy face) will appear from where the Humanoid entered the maze. Evil Otto's appearance is directly related to how many robots you start with. The lower the number, the sooner Evil Otto appears. Evil Otto cannot be destroyed.

* Because the robots are attracted to you 'as the crow flies', they will tend to clump together and smash into each other. The best way to kill robots is to stand safely behind a wall and let them shoot and smash each other. The ball (Evil Otto) will also kill them. You can ignore some robots in the maze and let Otto kill them for you. Otto follows your position like the robots, so as he comes across the screen, lead him up and down into any remaining robots before you exit.

* If the robot cannot hit you with laser fire, they will still try to kill the Humanoid by attempting to run him over. 

* The walls in the maze are deadly. If the Humanoid or a robot runs into a wall, he is vaporized. (You score the points if a robot is destroyed by running into a wall). The wall will light up if the Humanoid is too close to it. 

* If you and a robot are in line and firing at each other, your shots will negate themselves out. In the later levels, this could prove deadly since they can keep up with your firepower. 

* An Interesting Quirk: There is a one pixel space between the Humanoid's head and shoulders. The game doesn't register it as existing so if a robot's shot goes through that space, the Humanoid doesn't die. 

* The robots always walk toward you unless you're in their line of fire; then they will pause to shoot. There are eight directions you and they can shoot. The only way to survive the higher levels (10,000 points +) is to learn the blind spots of the robots. If you are in a robot's blind spot he poses no threat, and you can concentrate on blasting the others. The angle shots are almost never necessary. It is very difficult to hit a robot with an angle shot. When you shoot, the Humanoid stops moving, when you can't move, you are vulnerable. Make your shots count and don't bother wasting your time with angles unless you are on an early level and need the practice. 

* Because the robots are shorter than you, try to avoid robots at the bottom edge of the screen. By the time you move low enough to get a shot they will have already fired. In contrast, if you come 'up' on robots from the bottom, you can shoot their feet and duck back down before their shot reaches you. 

* Because the Humanoid is a lot taller than he is wide, it is very easy to avoid shots from above and below. Take out the robots to the sides of you first. 

* If you poke your head above a wall just far enough to shoot above it, the robots on the other side of it can't shoot you. They will only hit the wall. ALWAYS use this tactic to kill most of the robots in a maze. When you are in the right position, just hold down the fire button. This will make the Humanoid stand still. You can inch your way very close to the deadly walls without fear of running into them. When shooting up or down, that trick doesn't work. If there is a wall between you and a robot above you, run to the right and start shooting up just past the wall. If you are lucky, the robot will walk into your fire before he gets a shot off. By design, if a robot is above you, he will lock into position directly in-line with your shots, and you will shoot each other's bullets. In early rounds you can overpower a robot and outgun him, but later the robots can keep up with you and you will be in a deadlock. To defeat him, shoot up and immediately walk to the right and he will walk into your bullet. 

* The robots are programmed to avoid colliding into the sides of the deadly walls, but they can't detect the start or end of a wall. If a robot is below the end of a wall, you can move up and direct him into the wall end. 

* In later rounds, all of the real action takes place in the first two or three seconds of a round. If you survive the initial shots from the robots, you are as good as done with the maze. When a new maze comes on screen, you are very vulnerable. Often you are in the line of fire of five robots. As the new maze slides on-screen, you can see it before the robots appear. Use this time to decide which way to run. Assume that there will be a robot in each 'room' or 'nook'. Shoot the robot right in front of you first, and then run toward his position. By running ahead, you will exit the line of fire of any robots above/below you and also the dreaded angle shots. Once you are out of their line of fire, you can re-enter their line of fire selectively and shoot them. Get to a safe barrier as soon as possible and wait for the robots to move into easy positions.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 46 years ago:

Breakout (c) 1976 Atari, Incorporated.

Breakout sets up with eight rows of bricks; each two rows are different colors. The color order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange, and red. Players get three balls to try to knock down as many bricks as possible by ricocheting the ball against the wall off of a video sledge hammer. The higher the row, the more points the bricks are worth. To add to the challenge, the hammer decreases to half its size after the ball breaks through the red row and hits the upper wall. Ball speed increases after four hits, increased again after twelve, to highest speed in the orange and red rows.

- TRIVIA -

Breakout was released in April 1976.

Nolan Bushnell put out the word at Atari that he would pay anyone who could design the game and reduce the number of ICs that it used, $100 per IC removed from the design. Steve Jobs, at the time a low-paid technician at Atari, accepted the challenge. He originally attempted to work on the design himself, but soon found himself in way over his head. He then brought in his friend Steve Wozniak, who liked to hang out at Atari and playtest the new games as they rolled off the assembly lines.

Woz and Jobs stayed up for four days working on the design. Woz would work on the game at night, take a small catnap, go to work at his day job at Hewlett-Packard, and then return home at night to resume work on the design. In the end, Woz reduced the design down to 42 ICs, and both he and Jobs contracted mono from staying up for four days straight working on it. Jobs received a $5,000 bonus and told Woz it was only $700 and gave Steve Wozniak his '50%'... $350.

Years later this truth would come out and it would add to the already increasing friction between the two which eventually lead to Steve Wozniak quitting Apple. Meanwhile at Atari, the Breakout design was ingenious, however no one could figure it out so production could not begin. Al Alcorn says about Woz's design, "It was remarkable... a tour de force. It was so minimized, though, that nobody else could build it. Nobody could understand what Woz did but Woz. It was this brilliant piece of engineering, but it was just unproduceable. So the game sat around and languished in the lab".

In the end, Alcorn assigned another engineer to redesign the game so that it was more easily replicated. The final game had about 100 ICs.

Approximately 11,000 units were produced. There was an upright dedicated cabinet with sideart of the word 'Breakout' in red letters, being smashed in by a ball. There was also a unique looking round cocktail version, the cocktail is easier to find today because people rarely did conversions on cocktail tables.

Zachary Hample of New York holds the official record for this game with 896 points on June 25, 2002.

Carnival (c) 1980 Gremlin/Sega Ind., Incorporated.

CARNIVAL is a 1 or 2 player alternate action game that simulates a carnival shooting gallery. The playfield consists of three target rows, a rotating pipe wheel, a bonus message panel, and a 'special' target block.

The player uses a left right control to position a rifle at the bottom of the screen, and a shoot control to fire the rifle. Two rows of bullets at the bottom of the screen indicate the number of shots remaining to the player. Every time the player shoots, one of the bullets disappears from the screen. More bullets are given during the first round than the others, so, the inexperienced player will have a chance to enjoy the play.

The game ends when the player runs out of bullets. This can occur on any round. A round ends when the player clears the playfield of all targets. At this point, a special 'shoot the bear' sequence appears, and when this is finished the player proceeds to the next more difficult (and higher scoring) round. This is Gremlin's Multi-Phase design concept that keeps games challenging to players of all levels.

When a player completes a round (ending with 'shoot the bear' sequence), the screen flips to the other player. When the original player resumes play, he advances to the next level of difficulty, exactly as he would have if the screen had not flipped to the other player. This method allows the players to more directly compare their scores, since they are always within one round of each other. Note that the player who ends the game first does not necessarily lose--he might still have the higher score when the game ends.

The three target rows move in a horizontal line from left to right (top row), right to left (middle row) and left to right (bottom row). There are five types of targets. The rows move as a continuous band--the targets exiting the playfield from the right side of the bottom row reappear at the left of the top row. The point value for hitting a row target is indicated along the right side of the game--maximum points for a top row target, medium points for a middle row target, and minimum points for a bottom row target. These values increase from round to round.

Rabbits and owls are simple targets, which disappear when hit.

Numbered sign targets award additional bullets to the player when hit, as well as awarding the points indicated for the row. These targets appear only on the top two rows to make them relatively difficult targets.

Five small letters, B, 0, N, U and S are randomly interspersed through the target rows. At the upper right of the playfield is the word ''bonus" spelled out is small letters. If the player manages to hit the moving bonus letters in order (b-o-n-u-s) a special bonus is awarded. The fact that the bonus is still active is shown by the bonus word in the upper right of the playfield. Every time a bonus letter in the correct order is hit, the small corresponding letter in the bonus panel enlarges to show that it has been hit. Whenever a bonus letter is hit out of order, the bonus panel disappears until the next round. The bonus panel reappears at the beginning of every round. The bonus value is determined by adding row target points into the bonus value. When the "B" letter is hit, the bonus value freezes for that round. This encourages waiting as long as possible before attempting to score the bonus.

Ducks are special targets. Whenever a duck reaches the bottom row, it is capable of leaving the row and flying down toward the player. If the duck manages to get past the player's rifle without being shot, it flies down to the bullet row and quickly eats 10 bullets. A maximum of three ducks can escape simultaneously.

The target rows move as a continuous band of targets, and no new owls, rabbits, or bonus letter targets are added once the round starts. 'More shots' targets and ducks are added during a round. The frequency of adding duck targets is tied to the round number. As the rounds get more difficult, more ducks are added as the round progresses.

A flying duck hit scores no points.

Bullets left over at the end of a round earn 50 points each.

The between rounds 'shoot the bear' sequence operates as a shooting gallery bear. Whenever the bear is hit, it rears up, roars, and continues motion in the opposite direction. Each hit speeds up the bear, and increases the point value, which is shown above the bear for each hit. When the bear leaves the screen (which it will always do eventually, since it speeds up with each hit) the between rounds sequence ends and a new round begins. As the rounds progress, more bears (a maximum of 4) appear on the screen simultaneously.

A special yellow-rimmed score panel appears in the upper left of the playfield, and stays on for random lengths of time. Four types of panels appear here, which either add or subtract points or bullets. Hitting any part of the panel border awards the score shown inside.

The bullet bonus panel is shown with a large plus sign, and a row of bullets. Immediately after appearing, the bullets begin disappearing fairly rapidly. When the bullets are depleted, the panel disappears. If hit, the player is awarded the number of bullets left in the panel when it was hit.

The score bonus is shown with the same large plus sign, and a score value. As with the bullets, the score value quickly decreases, until it hits zero and disappears.

The minus panels are similar to those above except a large minus sign indicates the number of bullets or points subtracted when hit. This discourages the practice of parking on the left margin and shooting--a miss will hit the negative target. These panels show a fixed number of bullets or points, and after a random time interval, disappear.

The pipe wheel contains 8 pipes of 4 different colors. A panel beneath the wheel restricts pipe hits to horizontally oriented pipes, and also indicates the point value for hitting a pipe. Every shot the player takes decrements the pipe value, except a shot which hits a pipe. This makes it advisable to hit pipes early in the round, when it is most difficult (since the player must shoot through heavily populated target rows). Hitting two pipes of the same color with two consecutive shots awards a bonus of four times the pipe value shown in the panel.

CARNIVAL is accompanied by background music. At the beginning of every round, the music begins at a slow rate and relatively low key. As the round progresses, the music speeds up and the melody shifts up in key. This gives the player a growing sense of urgency. As the round progresses, the playfield motion also gradually speeds up.

A small panel on the right of the playfield contains a musical note symbol. If the player wishes to turn off the music, he simply shoots the note panel. This makes the note disappear, and turns off the music. Hitting the panel again makes the note reappear and resumes the music. The note thus acts as a 'flip-flop' switch to turn the music on and off.

Every round begins with the music on.

There is a special case to consider near the end of a round: the player has cleared all of the targets except the ducks, and has plenty of bullets left so that he can simply sit and wait for the ducks. He would, in effect, prolong the game by refusing to end the round.

Theoretically, by hitting the ducks and 'more shots' signs, the round could be prolonged indefinitely. However, an internal "doomsday" timer in the game keeps track of how long a round has lasted. After a certain time limit (the same for each round), the frequency of new duck appearances increases dramatically.

The top 3 scores are shown during advertising, along with the player's initials. A player who scores in the top 3 is allowed to enter 3 initials by a special routine explained at the time of their writing. The rank is updated during the round. The player is both audibly and visually rewarded. There is a pronounced audible sound as the player's score passes that of another ranking player's score. And, they may watch their rank progress during the game.

CARNIVAL's basic play action is outlined below, as it appears in the game instructions.

Shoot all targets and pipes to advance to the next round.
Game is over when you run out of bullets.
Escaped ducks eat 10 bullets.
Hit B-O-N-U-S letters in sequence for special bonus. Bonus value stops increasing when 'B' is hit.
Hit same color pipes with 2 consecutive shots to score 4 times pipe value. Shoot number signs for more bullets.
Shoot the bear between rounds for extra points.

[Upright model]

There were 2 different upright cabinets available for this game. The first upright was the standard Sega/Gremlin woodgrain cabinet. The second was a white cabinet.

The upright machines were decorated in mostly orange, with a circus theme. The woodgrain ones often did not have sideart, but the white ones usually did. Both versions used buttons on the control panel for movement.

- SCORING -

Shooting the bonus box at the top left: the score inside the box (+ or -).
Shooting an object in the top row scores the points at the right of the screen level with the top row (50, 60, etc).
A hit in the 2nd row scores the points at the right of the screen level with the 2nd row (30, 40, etc).
A hit in the bottom row scores the points at the right of the screen level with the bottom row (10, 20, etc).
A hit on a polar bear in the intermission screen scores 50 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Make any ducks on the lowest level your priority at the start of a screen, as they will soon swoop down to steal some of your ammunition.

* Keep an eye out for the passing boxed '5' and '10' symbols, as these award 5 or 10 extra bullets respectively when shot. You won't have enough ammo to complete a screen without at least hitting a few of these.

* You can stay to the left of the screen, which will enable you to pick off any good bonuses in the bonus box at an early stage. Don't get too trigger happy though, or you might be dropping your score or losing a lot of ammo too quickly if you hit a negative 'bonus'.

* The key to getting a lot of hits on the polar bear(s) in the bonus stage is to concentrate on only one bear and hit it as close to dead centre as possible. If you do this keep firing rapidly and you'll rack up a few points as it won't be able to escape from a constant barrage of bullets.

* Extra bullet '5' and '10's only appear on the top two rows and don't reappear at the top after going offscreen from the middle row so make sure you pick them off whenever possible.

Crossbow (c) 1983 Exidy.

Early first-person shoot'em up game with a dungeons and dragons feel about it. Features good speech and screams.

Gameplay requires the player to protect a band of adventurers (referred to as "friends" by the game) from afar by shooting objects that threaten them. The adventurers enter from the left-hand side of the screen and attempt to cross the screen unharmed. If the player helps them reach the opposite side of the screen safely, the adventurers survive to the next scenario, and new adventurers are occasionally granted between scenarios. In addition to the obstacles, the adventurers are vulnerable to the player's shots. The first time the player shoots an adventurer, an on-screen message is shown: "DON'T SHOOT YOUR FRIENDS!" Thereafter, shooting an adventurer will cause him/her to emit a cry of pain, and to walk at a slower pace the rest of the way. A second shot will kill the adventurer.Scenarios are chosen by shooting a destination on a map screen, which include: town, desert, volcano, cave, bridge, jungle, and castle.

The short path to reach the castle is by using the following Color paths -&gt;  Green -&gt; Blue -&gt; Blue -&gt; Red.

The goal is to reach the final scenario, past the castle, in which the player confronts the Master‚Äîwho presumably created the dangers in the game. Defeating the Master of Darkness requires shooting him in the eyes when they turn red (and deadly). The player is treated to a brief congratulation and a challenge to defeat the Master again, but if you dare. Following this screen the player starts over with however many adventurers survived the confrontation.

Defender (c) 1980 Williams.

Defender is a legendary sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up - the very first of its genre - in which the aim is to pilot a laser-firing spaceship and protect humanoids stranded on the planet's surface from swarms of alien abductors.

A long-range scanner at the top of the screen shows the positions of both the humanoids and the attacking aliens. The ideal strategy is to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If a humanoid is captured, the alien abductor can still be destroyed, but the player must then catch the falling humanoid and return it to the safety of the planet's surface before it falls to its death.

If an alien is allowed to carry its victim to the very top of the screen, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien that captured it. This new and deadly mutation will then immediately join in the alien attack.

The challenge becomes more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors. There are also mother ships that must be destroyed; these are particularly difficult as a direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that must also be wiped out. Throughout the entire mission, the player must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a fast and dangerous enemy.

Players have two escape options to use as a last resort. The first is the 'smart bomb', which destroys all on-screen enemies. The second option is 'hyperspace', which randomly teleports the player's ship to another part of the level. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left.

If all humanoids are successfully abducted, the planet will explode in a blinding flash and the waves remaining until the next planet is reached take place in outer space, and consist solely of destroying enemy waves.

- TRIVIA -

According to Defender development lead Eugene Jarvis: The game was shown at AMOA Chicago October 31, 1980 and released a week or two later on November 15, 1980.

Along with Namco's seminal "Pac-Man", Defender shares the title of 'Highest Grossing Video Game of All Time' and to date has earned more than one billion dollars. It's interesting to note that when the now-legendary shoot-em-up was first shown at a 1981 Chicago arcade machine trade show, it was deemed to be a flop due to its high level of difficulty. Arcade industry insiders confidently predicted that both Defender and Pac-Man would be commercial flops and that Namco's "Rally-X" would be the next major arcade success. 

Defender's attract mode for the game was programmed in just five hours. 

Defender was noted for both its superb sound and visual effects and, moreover, for its extremely demanding gameplay. This didn't, however, stop players from accumulating millions of points when playing the game. Just minutes after the opening of the AMOA - an arcade industry trade show - Eugene Jarvis and his team - Defender's creators - were burning new ROMs for the game's display due to the fact they plugged the first burn into the board BACKWARDS and fried them. Due to the intimidating controls, hardly anyone at the show played the game and there were even rumours circulating suggesting that both Pac-Man and Defender would flop and that Namco's Rally-X would be the next big hit. Not only did Defender have the highest number of controls (five buttons, in addition to a two-way joystick) but it was also the first video game to feature an artificial 'world', in that game events occurred OUTSIDE the on-screen viewing area presented to the player. 

Chris Hoffman holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 79,976,975 points on January 1, 1984. 
Bill Jones holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 543,950 points on August 15, 2008. 

Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Star Trek 1981", "Defence Command", "Defense Command", "Zero" (Jeutel), and "Tornado" (Jeutel). 

Defender inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Defender' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

A Defender unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'. 

The official video of the 1982 pop song "Herbergsvater", by Joachim Witt, begins by featuring a Defender unit and contains long scenes of Defender gameplay.

A mini Defender unit appears in the 1983 music video 'Almost Over You' by Sheena Easton. 

MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1983: win the most points by using your Defender ships to protect Humanoids from waves of aliens. A set of chance cards will bring the different aliens (Bombers, Landers and Humanoids) into play. Movement is determined with a spinner. Players can move their defenders and aliens.

- UPDATES -

Defender ROM sets were distinguished by early and later editions. The early edition supported only upright cabinets. In 1981 Williams released a cocktail cabinet version which necessitated extra code to flip the video display and to support a second set of game controls. The editions had some minor differences in the game's attract mode: The early edition gave an erroneous point value of '100' for alien landers; this was corrected to '150' in the later edition. Also, the high score value for player PGD was '14185' in the early edition and '14285' in the later edition. 

Early edition ROM sets: 
* Defender (White Label) 
* Defender (Green Label) 
* Defender (Blue Label) 

Later edition ROM sets: 
* Defender (Red Label)

- SCORING -

Lander: 150 points.
Mutant: 150 points.
Baiter: 200 points.
Bomber: 250 points.
Pod: 1,000 points.
Swarmer: 150 points.
Completely destroying a pod with a smart bomb: 1,150, 1,300, 1,450, 1,600, 1,750, 1,900, or 2,050 points. 
* The chances that a bombed pod will score 1,150, 1,300, or 1,450 points are 1/256 each.

Getting hit by an enemy bullet: 25 points.

Saving a humanoid from a Lander: 500 points.
Depositing a humanoid into the ground: 500 points.
Humanoid landing into the ground safely on his own: 250 points.

Bonus at the end of each wave: 
Wave 1: Humanoids Left X 100.
Wave 2: Humanoids Left X 200.
Wave 3: Humanoids Left X 300.
Wave 4: Humanoids Left X 400.
Wave 5 and above: Humanoids Left X 500.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The enemies that initially appear in each wave are: 
Wave 1: 15 Landers 
Wave 2: 20 Landers, 3 Bombers, and 1 Pod 
Wave 3: 20 Landers, 4 Bombers, and 3 Pods 
Waves 4 and up: 20 Landers, 5 Bombers, and 4 Pods 

* Avoid using hyperspace unless you are about to die. Fighting off attacks, regardless of the number of enemies, will make you a better Defender player. 

* Baiters can usually be overcome by hitting the reverse button twice quickly. They will fly past you and be in range for your fire power. Do NOT try to outrun them as baiters are faster than your ship. 

* Swarmers are easy to defeat. You can hit reverse as soon as they fly past you and fly behind them. They cannot shoot backwards so you can blast away at will. 

* Shooting a Pod will release between 1 and 7 Swarmers. The chances that it will try to release 1, 2, or 3 Swarmers is 1/256 for each. Also, the maximum number of Swarmers allowed in the game is 20. So, for example, if there are 18 Swarmers in the game and a Pod is hit, it can only release a maximum of 2 Swarmers. 

* At higher levels, you will need to play God and even sacrifice some Humanoids (by killing them yourself) to preserve the rest of the planet's population. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from a fate worst than death (mutation). Do not worry, these Humanoids reproduce quickly and overpopulation has always been a constant problem. The planet will be fully populated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable). 

* The International Date Line: there are reverse lines for Swarmers and Mutants (AKA the 'International Date Line'). If this line is between you and the type of enemy in question, they will travel the opposite direction around the planet to get you (i.e. they won't cross this line to get to you). If a Mutant, say, is following you and you cross the Mutant reverse line (to the left of the big mountain) it will suddenly reverse direction and go around the other way. The same is true for the Swarmer reverse line (located approximately where your ship starts each wave). This doesn't affect Swarmers that you are following behind. If you're on one side of the line and a Pod is on the other and you shoot it open, the Swarmers will fly away from you and you can get in behind them immediately. The best use of these lines is where there are lots of Swarmers and/or Mutants that you don't want to hassle with. You stay near the line and go back and forth over it to keep the enemy on the other side of the planet. This is especially useful in space and waves that get really hairy. 

* Freeze: you can freeze a Defender machine by picking up all ten Humanoids (on any wave, but Wave 1 is your greatest chance at success), stopping all forward motion of your ship, quieting the screen down (i.e. having no enemies moving around on it) and setting all the Humanoids straight down quickly. This seems to work better were the terrain is very close to the bottom of the screen. Everything will freeze, but you can still move your ship up and down. Thrusting will break the spell, so to speak. If you do pick a spot with shallow terrain, some Humanoids will go thru the bottom of the screen and appear suspended in mid-air near the top. This trick is good to use during marathon games when you've reached Wave 256 and need a breather. 

* Some top players begin each round by shooting all the Humanoids except for one, which they pick up. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from mutation, a fate worse than death. This keeps Mutants from developing, but it also means that the planet explodes if you lose your last Humanoid. The planet is fully repopulated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable). This can be considered an advanced trick. 

* Due to a bug in the algorithm that computes extra lives, every scoring activity from 990,000 to 999,975 will earn one extra ship and one extra Smart Bomb. If the player suicides on something or gets shot, one ship is lost, but one ship and one smart bomb are awarded; the net effect on the number of ships is zero. Dying on hyperspace re-entry awards nothing, because this awards no points. For winning N ships from 990,000 to 999,975, the player will have to achieve N x 10000 points after passing 1,000,000 before the game's accounting balances, and ships are awarded properly at 10,000 point intervals again. For example, if a player earns 45 extra lives during this interval, he will have to score another 450,000 points before being awarded another extra life. The player gets to keep surplus ships and bombs and can have super long turns where he may bomb two to three times per wave to get out of dangerous situations. 
* The trick is this: If the player wins 100+ ships between 990,000 and 1,000,000, this causes the game to start awarding extra lives right away again after turning the score over to zero. If the player wins 100 ships, the machine will have to wait 1,000,000 points to begin awarding ships again. However, since 1,000,000 is equivalent to zero, it awards them immediately at 1,010,000. 

* It's possible on a real Defender machine to make the screen color inverted so that all the black space is white while you are playing. It will reset itself when you die and maybe when you use hyperspace. Smart bomb flashes are cool when it's reversed. The trick was to drop a credit in right when you die and the screen flashes white. Somehow the program gets distracted (non-masked interrupt on coin drop?) and the screen stays white. 

* Defender attack waves 'roll over' at Wave 100, which is displayed, after being completed, as Wave 0. The game keeps track of the actual number of waves, even though they are not shown properly. For example, the next wave will be counted as Wave 101, even though it shows being completed as Wave 1. The game will 'roll over' again at Wave 200, which is displayed, after being completed, as Wave 0 as well. 
The next 'roll over' occurs at Wave 256. Upon completion of Wave 255, the next wave is a 'blank' wave, in which no enemies appear, and the wave immediately ends after the player‚Äôs ship appears on screen. This level is counted and displayed as Wave 0, and the player is awarded a bonus of humanoids left X 0 points (the bonus for this wave is always 0 points). The next is Wave 1, and the game now plays just as if the player had started a new game, except the player gets to keep his score and all of his bonus ships and smart bombs.

Frogger (c) 1981 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

Frogger is a one or two-player game in which players must overcome a number of hazards to safely guide the green amphibian from the bottom of the screen to one of five home bases situated at the top of the screen.

The lower half of the screen consists of a bi-directional flow of traffic moving across five lanes. To navigate across the road safely, Frogger's hops must be timed to avoid the vehicles, which include buses, civilian traffic and racing cars, with different vehicle types moving at different speeds. As well as being able to hop vertically, Frogger can also move left and right, allowing him to move with the flow of traffic. 

The upper half of the screen consists of a fast-flowing river populated with logs, crocodiles and turtles. Frogger will drown if he has any contact with the water and these act as platforms onto which Frogger can hop. He must be careful to avoid contact with crocodiles' snapping jaws, however and some of the turtles will periodically dive below the water's surface, drowning Frogger. Frogger will also die if he is on a log, turtle or crocodile when it reaches the edge of the screen.

On the logs of the river section a female frog will occasionally appear and bonus points are awarded if Frogger successfully escorts her safely home. A fly also appears randomly in a home base and bonus points are awarded if Frogger enters the base when the fly is present. Conversely, a crocodile may also appear in a home base and a life is lost if Frogger enters the base while the crocodile is present.

A round is completed once five frogs have been guided safely home, after which the next round begins with an increased level of difficulty. This includes faster-moving vehicles on the road section and new, deadly hazards on the river section, including crocodiles, otters and snakes.

- TRIVIA -

Frogger was released by Konami in June 1981 in Japan; it became a runaway hit. 

1981 was a big year in video games. A lot of companies were putting some pretty popular games on the market and it created a very competitive atmosphere as to what company was putting out the most popular ones. In addition, 1981 continued on the trend of the 'cute' type games such as "Ms. Pac-Man", "Qix", and a host of Pac-Man clones. Konami was already becoming a force to be reckoned with in the video gaming world. With such hits as "Space War", "Scramble", and "Super Cobra", Konami was making its mark. 

The sound that can be heard when a coin is inserted into the machine was sampled by producer Richard X for the Sugababes' song, 'Freak Like Me' (and is the very first sound on the track). 

Frogger has numerous bugs, although many of these are not immediately apparent to the average player: 
1. Sections of the music will occasionally cut out, although the main melody will continue to play. 
2. On occasion, Frogger displays a somewhat haphazard approach to collision detection. One side effect of this is that the player can sometimes make a perfectly legal and safe jump and still lose a life. Another side effect of this is that the player can jump up onto the first row of turtles, and then immediately jump back. This will place the player 'off the grid', and it is now possible to jump right off the side of the screen, leading to a loss of life. 
3. There are several other odd jumps that can be made as well. Firstly, the player can 'hang off' the left side of a turtle, but attempting to do the same on the right side results in death. If the player jumps onto a home base with an alligator (and the 'gator vanishes after you jump, but before the player lands), Frogger will be killed, but he will ALSO make it home. Finally, left and right jumps on the top row of logs are sometimes much slower than usual - this is more likely to occur after previously eating a fly. 
4. Another in-game bug is that the lady frog will sometimes be invisible, but will flash red when the player jumps onto the spot where she is. 

Mark Robichek holds the official record for this game with 442,330 points. 

A Frogger unit appears in the 1999 movie 'Magnolia' and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men'; Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes). 

Frogger inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Froggy's Lament' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

The TV show, Seinfeld, has an episode named 'The Frogger'. George and Jerry are in Mario's Pizza which is closing down, and they find a Frogger game still there. They realize that the high score of 860,630 points has George's initials GLC [George Louis Costanza]. They reminisce about the night it happened: "I was unstoppable!... Just the right amount of grease on the joystick". George decides to buy the Frogger machine to immortalize his high score, but Jerry informs him that unplugging the game will erase all of the scores. Later, George tries in vain to call an electrician to help: "I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?". Kramer suggests an electrician who can help. George says, "Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me". George assembles a team and hatches a plan to salvage the game. But when he arrives, he finds the team playing the game, which has only three minutes of battery life left. They can't get it back in the closed pizzeria, but there is an open pharmacy across the street where it could be plugged in. George decides to push the machine across the highway, and an overhead shot of this feat looks much like the Frogger game itself, and the music from the game is played. At the end, George is unable to push the game onto the sidewalk and it gets destroyed by an oncoming truck. 

MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) the same year, 'One Wrong Leap Will Get You Squished And Splattered': in this version of the game, 2 players face off, each with their own army of frogs, logs, and automobiles. Each turn, a player spends his movement points either moving his frogs toward their goal (the other side of the board), or moving logs and cars in an attempt to block or squash the other player's frogs. Complete with 'bonus points' for landing on flies, this is actually a pretty faithful interpretation of the video-game, but far too simple to have any long-lasting interest. More of a curiosity for video game enthusiasts than anything. 

Frogger also spawned a cartoon series of the same name: Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced By Joe Ruby, Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. 

Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.

The main character appears on the 2012 animation movie "Wreck-It Ralph" from Walt Disney Animation Studios.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your frog will start at the bottom of the screen. You will have 60 seconds to move your frog up 10 spaces and successfully put it in one of the homes. If you are successful, then you will try to put another frog in another home and so on until you fill up all five homes with frogs. When you do this, you progress to the next level. 

* Note the traffic flow of the two parts. The cars travel on the roadway while the logs, turtles, crocodiles, etc. travel on the water lanes in the following direction: 
a) Lanes #1, #3, and #5 go from right to left. 
b) Lanes #2 and #4 go from left to right. 

* First, you must cross the highway. You will become roadkill if a vehicle hits you or you hit a vehicle. Try to find 'lanes' in between the vehicles. You must plan for gaps to form in the first three lanes so you don't become trapped. The vehicles in the first three lanes move slowly enough that you can jump side to side with reasonable safety. 

* Lane #4 is the dangerous lane. Depending on how much time you are taking, the cars may pick up speed even though it shows slow on the chart. Keep this in mind when you are moving your frog. 

* At level 3, a snake will either be in the median or on the log in water lane #3. The snake is deadly to your frog and you cannot hop over it. 

* The turtles are pretty easy to navigate over in water lanes #1 and #4. Be wary of the diving turtles and only use them as a quick bypass to a more solid footing. If your frog is on a diving turtle when it dives, your frog will drown. 

* Again, time your jumps to coincide with the logs and turtles to ensure you will always have a solid footing to jump to. As the levels progress, you will have less things you can jump to. 

* You can jump on the backs of the crocodiles and otters. Just don't get near their mouths or they are apt to turn your frog into a meal. 

* You may see a purple lady frog hopping around on a log in water lane #2. Just cross over her to give her a piggyback ride to your home and get an extra 200 points. 

* Watch out for the snakes, they sometimes like to ride on the logs. If you see a snake on a log, jump back to solid footing. 

* Your frog cannot 'wrap-around' the screen so make sure you bail off before that footing disappears off the edge of the screen or your frog will come out the other side in a squished condition. 

* By that same token, if you have the time and necessary footing, you can hold out until the fly appears in your home before you settle your frog in. That's another 200 points. 

* Try to fill in the two end homes before going for the middle. The hardest home to get into is the left-hand one (home #1) since everything in water lane #5 goes from right to left. This means you may have to bounce back to water lane #4 so you can get a good shot at your home. 

* Speaking of getting your frogs into their homes, you must hit exact center or your frog will die. Also, keep in mind that crocodiles like to randomly appear in your home. Make sure that your home is clear before trying to settle your frog down into it. 

* Again, if you waste too much time, the things on the river will move quicker so you will have to adjust your strategy accordingly. 

* When the game is playing in attract mode, you can control the frog. When the frog reaches water lane #4, you can control the frog's movements until you move either up or down. 

* If you jump into your home at the same time the crocodile is leaving your home, you will be credited with making to your home but you will still lose a frog in the process. 

* You can dangle your frog from the left side of the turtles but not the right side. 

* Your side-to-side movements in water lane #5 may be slow and sluggish. 

* The lady frog will sometimes be invisible. In this case, the only time you know she's there is when you jump on her. She will then ride on your back to your home.

Galaxian (c) 1979 Namco.

Galaxian is a legendary single-screen shoot-em-up that took everything that made Taito's ground-breaking "Space Invaders" so good, and improved upon it on every level. Each screen starts with a wave of multi-colored aliens moving left and right at the top of the screen; the aliens quickly break ranks and start dive-bombing the Galaxip (player's ship) - either in single units or in groups of 3 - dropping multiple missiles as they descend. All of the aliens need to be destroyed before the player can progress to the next wave. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Galaxip: This is the name of the ship which you control at the bottom of the screen. 

Galaxian: These attacking aliens come in three varieties: blue, purple, and red. They begin in formation at the top of the screen and will occasionally swoop down to attack you before returning to their position in the formation. 

Flagship: At least two of these appear at the top of the formation at the start of each stage. They will swoop down to attack with one or two red Galaxians if any are nearby. If a flagship is one of the last enemies left of the screen, it will run away and appear as a third Flagship at the start of the next stage.

- TECHNICAL -

This was the first title to use the now familiar 'Namco Cabinet', which was used for Galaxian, "Galaga", "Pac-Man", "Ms. Pac-Man". Several other titles used nearly identical cabinets as well. These machines are white, with painted sideart of a green dragonfly alien (done up in blue, green. and black). The marquee is rather large and displays a blue and green 'Galaxian' logo (which is painted on a sheet of glass, they don't make them like that anymore). The control panel and monitor bezel are not highly decorated, but do feature some game instructions. Finally this machine uses neon green t-molding (edge trim), it is difficult to find replacement trim in that same exact shade.

The earliest Galaxian machines used a 25-inch G02 monitor, but later machines shipped with the standard 19-inch Electrohome G07 monitor. Any normal standard resolution arcade monitor should work as a replacement. "Pac-Man" PCBs will work in Galaxian machines, but require a 4-way joystick, instead of the 2-way model that Galaxian normally has. The sound pinout is also different, so one would need to rewire the connector to hear any Pac-Man sounds. You can also plug a Galaxian PCB into a Pac-Man. Again, the sound would need to be wired up at the connector and you'd have to push UP on the joystick to fire.

- TRIVIA -

Galaxian was released on October 31, 1979 in Japan.

Galaxian was the first video game to be released with 100 percent of its graphics displayed in true R.G.B. color. 

Space battles of all kinds played a major role during the golden age of video games. With the introduction of Galaxian, players were transported to the most colorful and challenging space battle yet.

* A place in video game history: "Galaxian captivated the minds of quite a few arcade enthusiasts," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It was a relatively early entry in the golden age of video games, and it capitalized on the enthusiasm created by the earlier video game classic, "Space Invaders", while providing a more colorful, enjoyable, and demanding gaming experience.
Galaxian had smarter bad guys than "Space Invaders", and it demanded that the player really pay attention to what was going on. And there were no shields, like many games have today. You really had to stay on the ball. Galaxian also had great sound and used elements that have since become standard -- such as flags and other symbols to mark the player's progression through different levels of game play.".

* The great 25-cent escape: "Galaxian definitely gets an enthusiastic response," Lindsey said. "In fact, I deliberately position the game near the entrance of the museum. Often it's the first game people go to." Lindsey often sees parents trying to convey to their child the excitement of these great games. "It is funny for me when I see a father trying to explain a game to his kid. Junior really just wants to get on the game and figure it out, and Dad wants to do a demo. Dad starts instructing Junior while Junior is sort of looking around, wondering how he can get away. But Dad continues, busily explaining the nuances of the game, which he knows Junior can't get on the first play. This all shows the enthusiasm that a certain generation still has for these terrific games."
With or without a parent's help, Lindsey sees a younger generation embracing the classic arcade games. "Kids by themselves will actually do quite well on these games," Lindsey said. "I'm somewhat surprised when I see how good kids are at picking up games. I sort of think that because I'm older, I should be able to play better, and that's not always the case with video games. That's a lesson an entire generation has had to learn.".

* Namco notes: Galaxian was one of Namco's first video games, and engineers throughout the company were gathered into a special team. As the game neared completion, the engineers suspected they had created a good game because other Namco employees were extremely "excited and crazy about the game." Once Galaxian was released, they knew they had a winner because, as one Namco engineer reported, "People [at the arcades] piled their coins onto the game cabinets to keep playing, and those who were waiting were very irritated because their turn never came. There were huge lines of people around each machine.".

The Galaxian Flagship became a trademark of Namco as it makes cameo appearances in other Namco classics:
* "Pac-Man" (1980) and "Pac-Man Plus" (1982): The flagship makes an appearance as the bonus fruit in rounds 9 and 10, and is worth 2,000 points if Pac-Man eats it. 
* "Galaga" (1981): The flagship makes an appearance as one of the "transform" ships. It splits into 2, then 3 clones of itself. They are worth 160 points each, and killing all 3 scores a bonus of 3,000 points. 
* "Dig Dug" (1982): The flagship makes an appearance as the bonus vegetable in rounds 16 and 17, and is worth 7,000 points if Dig Dug picks it up. 
* "Super Pac-Man" (1982): All regular edible items on rounds 15, 31, 47, and 63 are flagships, and they are worth 150 points each. Starting from their second appearance, Round 31, they are 160 points instead. 
* "Pac &amp; Pal" (1983): The flagship makes an appearance as one of the "special items" that make Pac-Man turn blue when eaten, and allows him to stun the ghosts for a short while by shooting a Galaga-style tractor beam. It is worth 1,000 points if Pac-Man eats it or intercepts it from Miru. 
* "Pac-Land" (1984): The ghosts in airplanes sometimes drop flagships and they are worth 7,650 points (765 being Namco's goroawase number in Japanese) if eaten. 
* "Super Xevious" (1984): The flagship makes an appearance in a silver form and as an enemy, and sometimes several of them attack at once. They are worth 300 points each. 
* "Quester" (1987): In Round 5, the bricks form a Galaxian Flagship.
* "Pac-Mania" (1987): The flagship makes a 3-D appearance as a special item and in two forms as well, the other one being the silver form from "Super Xevious". The regular one and the silver one are worth 7,650 points if eaten.
* "Pistol Daimyo no Bouken" (1990): The flagship makes an appearance as an enemy along with the other Galaxian characters, and they attempt to hit Pistol Daimyo with their fire. 
* "Tinkle Pit" (1994): The flagship also makes an appearance with the other Galaxian characters, but this time they appear as bonus items. It is worth 800 points if collected. 
* "Tekken" (1994 - Arcade, 1995 - PlayStation) and "Tekken 2" (1995 - Arcade, 1996 - PlayStation): Winning at least seven rounds in Arcade Vs. mode will reveal the Galaxian flagship on the lower left (or right) hand corner of the screen. In order for this to work, "Number of Wins Shown By" must be set to Fruit. 
* "Namco Classic Collection Vol.1" (1995): The flagship makes an appearance in "Galaga Arrangement" as a Challenging Stage enemy in Space-Plant Zone (Stage 20) and normally in Space-Flower Zone (Stage 26). If killed normally, they are worth 150 points. If killed in Challenging Stage, they are worth 300 points.
* "Namco Classic Collection Vol.2" (1996): The flagship appears in both "Pac-Man Arrangement" and "Dig Dug Arrangement". In "Pac-Man Arrangement", it makes its appearance in World 4-1 and 4-2 and is worth 5,000 points if Pac-Man eats it. In "Dig Dug Arrangement", it appears in Stages 17 and 18 and is worth 7,000 points if Dig Dug picks it up.
* "Pac-Man World" (1999): The flagship appears again in a Pac-Man game. This time, the item must be collected in order to access the mazes.
* "Pac-Man World 2" (2002) and "Pac-Man World 3 (2005): The flagship teleports Pac-Man to mazes. The point value will be the same as the points earned in the maze (if completed), plus 2000.
* "Namco Museum Battle Collection" (2005): The arrangement versions of "Pac-Man" and "Dig Dug", later called "Pac-Man Remix" and "Dig Dug Remix" in the iOS version, feature the flagship. "Pac-Man Remix" features both the flagship, worth 3,200 points, and the red drone, worth 2,800 points, as fruit items, while on "Dig Dug Remix", the flagship is a vegetable item and is worth 7,000 points. 
"Dig Dug - Digging Strike" (2005): Just like the first "Dig Dug", the flagship appears as a vegetable on stage 13, except it's worth 6,000 points.
"Pac-Man Championship Edition" (2007) and "Pac-Man Championship Edition DX" (2010): The flagship reappears, but is this time joined by the Galaga Boss, Queen Gaplus, and two drones, one each from "Galaga" and Galaxian.

Gary Whelan holds the official record for this game with 1,114,550 points, achieved August 24, 2006 at Dukinfield in the UK.

The game can be played while the main game loads in the Sony PlayStation's port of "Ridge Racer".

- UPDATES -

The only code difference between the original Namco version and the licensed Midway version is that the 'Bonus Galaxip' text is printed on a different line.

In Namco Set 2: 
* Lives dip switch can be set to 3 or 5 lives. The default is 3 lives.
* Extra life dip switch can be set to 4,000 (meaning a bonus Galaxip at 4,000 points), 5,000 points, 7,000 points, or None (meaning no bonus Galaxip at any time). The default is 4,000.

In Midway Set 2: 
* Extra life dip switch can be set to None, 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000. The default is None.

In the bootleg version: 
* Extra life dip switch can be set to None, 20,000, 40,000, or 80,000. The default is None.

- SCORING -

Blue Galaxian: 30 points in formation, 60 points in flight
Purple Galaxian: 40 points in formation, 80 points in flight
Red Galaxian: 50 points in formation, 100 points in flight
Flagship: 60 points in formation, 150 points in flight
Flagship: 200 points in flight with one escort
Flagship: 300 points in flight with two escorts, Flagship killed before both escorts
Flagship: 800 points in flight with two escorts, Flagship killed after both escorts

* The maximum possible score shown is 999,990. Scores higher than this roll back to zero, but the high score will show the last score achieved before the rollover, which can vary from 999,990 to 999,200.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game. The Galaxians will be set up in formation and your Galaxip will be placed in the middle of the bottom of the screen. The action starts immediately. You can only have one shot in the air at any time so plan your shots accordingly. The game starts off slowly with only 2 or 3 Galaxians attacking your Galaxip at one time. They will drop 3 to 4 laser shots. As the waves progress, more Galaxians will come after your Galaxip until you will usually have 10-15 at any one time swooping down on it.

Each wave starts out with the Galaxians in formation, in the following quantities (in order from top to bottom):
Flagships: 2 (plus any that have escaped from battle in the previous wave, up to a maximum of 4 altogether)
Red Galaxians (Escorts): 6 (in 1 row, directly below the flagships)
Purple Galaxians: 8 (in 1 row, directly below the red Galaxians)
Blue Galaxians: 30 (in 3 rows of 10, directly below the purple Galaxians)

Flagships and red Galaxians are special enemies: they create convoys. Flagships have other special properties (see below). Purple and blue Galaxians are regular enemies.

* The Galaxip can fire only shot on the screen at a time. It is possible to kill 2 enemies with one shot if they are flying extremely close to each other.

* Missiles shot at the formation which miss by going between columns or near an outer edge of a column, will cause the formation to pause its left-right movement for a very short moment. This will usually, but not always, prevent missed shots near the columns from hitting the enemies in the upper rows of the formation which might otherwise be hit by moving into the shot as it flies by.

* Enemies peel away from the formation and attack the Galaxip. Enemies fire at the Galaxip during their attack, but they can‚Äôt fire after they pass an invisible horizontal line just above the Galaxip.

* Enemies always begin attack runs from the edges of the formation, never from the middle. This also applies to Flagships but it is not readily observable unless there are 3 or 4 Flagships present.

* A 'swarm' is triggered by either of 2 criterion:
1. The total number of enemies in formation is 3 or less.
2. The total number of blue and purple Galaxians in formation is zero. This can occur when there are many Flagships and red Galaxians still present in formation.

* When the 'swarm' starts, enemies that begin an attack do not return to formation: they keep attacking. Once started, a 'swarm' can only be ended by killing all of the enemies and/or letting them escape, or by the Galaxip getting hit. 

* Before the 'swarm' starts, enemies that attack, which are not killed, return to the formation. Since these enemies were on the edge of the formation and able to attack once, they are very likely to attack again soon.

* When not in 'swarm', a maximum of 4 regular enemies can attack at any one time.

* Flagships and convoys can attack at any time as long as another convoy attack is not already commencing; only one convoy attack can happen at a time.

* A Flagship will always create a convoy with the maximum number of red escorts available to it, unless the 'swarm' has started.

* The Flagships 'capture' up to 3 red escorts while they are in formation:  Whenever there is a Flagship in formation directly above an escort or above it to one side, that escort is captured and cannot attack on its own. This capture effect ends when a 'swarm' begins.

* The Flagships can escape from the battle only if all three red escorts under their place in the formation have been killed. Flagships that escape will appear on the next attack wave, up to a maximum of 4 Flagships at the start of any wave.

* When an attacking Flagship is killed, all enemies stop firing for a short period of time. If this kill occurs before the 'swarm', there will also be no new attacks from the formation during this period. These benefits never occur for killing a Flagship that is in formation.

* The flags which count the rounds show a maximum of round 48; rounds 48 and up are shown as round 48. However if round 256 is achieved, the flags start to roll over, but with some graphical glitches; the flags that were showing round 48 begin to get overwritten, one at a time. This results in the big 10-flags being cut in half by the regular flags which start to appear, until all 4 of the 10-flags are replaced by small ones. 16 single flags show during rounds 256+8 and 256+9 (rounds 264 and 265). The glitch ends at round 256+10 (266), which shows a single 10 flag.

* After wave 1, it is possible to kill any one enemy, even a Flagship, in a brand new formation by shooting at just the right time and place before the formation teleports in at the start of a new round.

* The Galaxians that come down in a smooth pattern are the easiest to kill plus their shots are easy to avoid. The hard ones to kill (usually the purple Galaxians) are the ones where the Galaxian 'bounces' from side-to-side dropping shots since those shots cover a very large area.

* The corners can be a death trap. When the Galaxians come down firing, their shots do not come straight down but they angle toward the direction that the Galaxian is traveling. In addition, the Galaxians have a tendency to 'charge' into the corners. You get the points if a Galaxian rams your Galaxip but you also lose your Galaxip in the process.

* The Flagships are the big points in the game. Try to avoid shooting the red Galaxians since they act as escorts for the Flagship. Wait until a Flagship comes down with two escorts. If you can't get aligned to take all three out quickly, let them pass. If you do get a good angle on them, you will have to fire quickly to pick off the two escorts first, then the Flagship. If you hit the Flagship first, you get significantly less points.

* Do not stop moving. If you do, you will be caught in a crossfire. The Galaxians tend to leave small areas of safety open between their shots. Also, make sure you are constantly hitting their formation to reduce their numbers (again, don't kill off the red ones).

* As you progress into the higher waves, the Galaxians tend to move quicker, fly more erratic patterns, and 'gang up' on your Galaxip. Plan accordingly for this.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Gorf (c) 1981 Midway.

The player's goal is to defeat the Gorfian Empire and safeguard the future of mankind. Gorf is a single screen shoot-em-up in the classic "Space Invaders" mould, the prime difference being that Gorf offers five distinct levels of shooting action. The levels are as follows: 

* Mission 1 - Astro Battles: The first mission is more or less a straight clone of "Space Invaders", set against a sky-blue background. The player is protected by a glittering parabolic force field, which is gradually worn away by enemy projectiles. The force field also works in BOTH directions, and therefore must momentarily deactivate in order for the player's ship to fire out. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the invaders. 

* Mission 2 - Laser Attack: The other missions are all set in space. In this mission, the player is faced with two formations each made up of five enemies. The formations are cross-shaped, and at the bottom of each formation is a single laser gun. The laser guns fire a long, dangerous yellow beam at regular intervals. At the same time, the other enemies may break formation and attempt to dive-bomb the player. Destroying a laser gun causes the corresponding formation to break apart. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the enemies. 

* Mission 3 - Galaxians: This mission is a clone of "Galaxian". The player is faced with a swarm of galaxians, which continually dive-bomb and shower the player with deadly projectiles. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the galaxians. 

* Mission 4 - Space Warp: A wormhole is situated in the middle of the screen out of which enemies ships emerge, one at a time, and spiral outward at increasing speed; whilst growing larger and flinging fireballs at the player. The Space Warp level would have an influence on Konami's superb "Gyruss", released two years later. To advance to the next mission, the player must survive a number of these enemies. 

* Mission 5, Flag Ship: The final mission is a one-on-one confrontation with the alien Flag Ship itself. The Flag Ship is one of the earliest examples of the 'boss' enemy in mainstream video games. It is equipped with its own force field, through which the player must blast in order to get a clean shot on the ship. It is also armed with a powerful fireball weapon. The player's weapon has a minor effect on the Flag Ship's hull, and can only blast off tiny pieces of it. This adds to the player's problems, as stray pieces of hull can destroy their ship. These pieces can be destroyed with a single shot. The only way to destroy the Flag Ship is to hit the glowing reactor at the heart of the ship, either by first blasting away the hull to expose it, or by managing to fire a shot directly into the tiny vent that leads to the reactor. 

Each time the Flag Ship is destroyed, the player advances in rank. Initially, the player begins with the rank of Space Cadet, before moving on to Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and finally Space Avenger. The player's spaceship is equipped with a Quark Laser which allows the player to cancel a poorly aimed shot and fire another shot.

- TRIVIA -

Released in February 1981 in the USA, Gorf was the first game ever to show multiple scenes. 

Gorf has achieved the status of 'true status' and became legendary for its groundbreaking, yet almost unintelligible speech.

This game featured some early speech synthesis that was done in a similar manner to that in "Wizard of Wor" (Gorf and Wizard of Wor ran on nearly identical hardware). Here is a list of the humorous phrases Gorf says throughout the game; [rank] denotes where Gorf speaks the player's current rank:  

Attract mode: 
1) Insert Coin!
2) I am the Gorfian Empire.
3) Long Live Gorf!
NOTE: Move the controller any time during the attract mode to trigger the speech.

Ready to play mode: 
1) Long Live Gorf!
2) Push a player button.

Mission start-up: 
1) Prepare yourself for annihilation, [rank]!
2) You will meet a Gorfian doom, [rank]!
3) Survival is impossible, [rank]!
4) You cannot escape the Gorfian robots!
5) I am the Gorfian Empire!
6) I am a Gorfian consciousness.
7) Gorfian robots...Attack! Attack!
8) Robot warriors, seek and destroy the [rank]!
9) My Gorfian robots are unbeatable!
10) Gorfians take no prisoners!

Player loses a ship: 
1) Got you, [rank]!
2) Bad move, [rank]!
3) Some galactic defender you are, [rank]!
4) Another enemy ship destroyed!
5) Your end draws near, [rank]!
6) Ha ha ha ha!

Player loses last ship: 
1) Too bad, [rank]!
2) Bite the dust, [rank]!

At game over: 
1) Gorfians conquer another galaxy.
2) You cannot escape the Gorfian Robots.
3) All hail the supreme Gorfian Empire!
4) Try again; I devour coins!

Player destroys Flag Ship (and advances in rank; [new rank] denotes where Gorf speaks the player's new rank): 
1) Nice shot! You have been promoted to [new rank]!
2) For hitting my Flag Ship, you have been promoted to [new rank]!
3) In the Gorfian chronicals, you have been promoted to [new rank]!
4) Next time will be harder, but for now you have been promoted to [new rank]!
NOTES: These phrases may not be easy to hear over the loud explosion of the Flag Ship. The Rank lamp on the bezel moves over to the next rank as soon as Gorf begins speaking. If the player destroys the Flag Ship while already at the highest rank (which is Space Avenger), the words "you have been promoted to" will be omitted from each of these phrases.

OTHER NOTES:  

Have you ever noticed that GORF is FROG spelled backwards? Seriously, GORF is an acronym for 'Galactic Orbital Robot Force'.

The game's creator, Jay Fenton, designed a sequel to Gorf called 'Ms. Gorf', but it was never released. Jay Fenton underwent a sex change and is now known as Jamie Fenton. 

A Star Trek tie in was originally planned by Midway, but when the first movie fell flat, the Enterprise sprite was reused as the Gorf Flag Ship. 

Todd Rogers holds the official record for this game with 653,990 points. 

A Gorf unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'. 

An upright Gorf unit appears in the 38 Special music video 'Caught Up In You' and the 1987 sitcom "Married... with Children"; Season 4, Episode 19 (Peggy Turns 300).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game. The first sight that will greet you are the Space Invaders. From that point on, the action will be non-stop with the only things changing are your rank and the difficulty of the enemies. Also, there is an interesting quirk in the game. If your ship hits a displayed score (after destroying some enemy), your ship will be destroyed. So avoid flying into scores. Also, you can only have one shot up at a time. This, though, can be countered by the fact that you can prematurely end a shot and fire another thus saving yourself a lot of time and perhaps your ship. 

* Due to Gorf's limited hardware not being powerful enough to move the game's colorful sprites around easily, it's possible, on the Astro Battles screen, to slow the last two invaders down to a crawl; simply by repeatedly firing. On the Laser Attack screen, if you shoot all the enemy ships EXCEPT for the laser shooters, you can sit forever on the far left hand side of the screen. Useless, but interesting all the same. 

* Astro Battles: 
1) Fire immediately when the mission starts. You may get lucky and hit the Gorfian robot distributing the Space Invaders. Also fire at the invaders as they are being distributed for more points. 
2) Instead of the normal 11x5 grid of invaders, you only have to deal with an 8x3 grid. 
3) Instead of buildings to protect your ship, you now have a shield dome over you. It briefly disappears when you fire, but the invaders have to cut through it with their lasers. 
4) Remember, you have a lot of maneuverability in your ship (i.e. you can go up and down) so it should be easy to avoid the invaders bombs. 

* Laser Attack: 
1) Your first priority should be the laser ships. Wait until they have fired and send a shot right up their laser cannon. 
2) The escorts tend to make random movements so be wary of them coming at you from all directions. 
3) As you advance higher in rank, everything speeds up accordingly. 

* Galaxians: 
1) Try to shoot the Galaxians when they are setting up to get the score for attacking Galaxians. 
2) At first, only a couple will come down. After a while, though, the Galaxians attempt to swarm all over your ship. Since they each fire three shots apiece, this can present a particularly deadly situation. 
3) Keep moving. There is no safe place (not even the corners). 
4) At later ranks, it isn't uncommon for a whole bunch of Galaxians to attack your ship at once. 
5) If you can, try to hit the Gorfian robot that sometimes bounds over the top of the Galaxians. 

* Space Warp: 
1) This is the mission that tends to kill off most players. You will see a black hole with dots in it. These dots represent the number of fighters you have to deal with coming out of the black hole. As a Space Cadet, you only deal with 12 fighters. From Space Captain onward, it will be 16 fighters. 
2) Fighters leave fast or slow and rotate around the hole. In addition, they will also fire at you. It will take some fancy maneuvering to avoid both the fighter and the shot it fired. 
3) Some fighters go around so fast, you just have to try to keep out of its way. 
4) Sometimes fighters will launch a slow shot from the side of the screen. Watch out for these shots. 
5) In the later ranks, it will take all of your skill to survive since everything moves very quickly on this mission. 

* Flag Ship: 
1) The Flag Ship will fly back and forth slowly. It will descend then ascend as it completes a back and forth movement. 
2) There is a shield around the Flag Ship you must cut through to hit it. The Flag Ship can fire through the shield at you. 
3) On the later ranks (starting with Space Captain), the Flag Ship is escorted by two Gorfian robots. 
4) Plan your shots so you can expose the reactor. This will mean cutting through a little bit of the ship to accomplish this. Watch out for the debris you create since it is as deadly as the Flag Ship's laser shots. If you feel really daring, hit the debris for extra points. 
5) After you have stripped the ship away from the reactor, a well-placed shot should obliterate the Flag Ship. 
6) Again, in the later ranks everything moves much faster.

Gyruss (c) 1983 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

Gyruss is a single-player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. 

It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a 'Chance Stage', a bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Chance Stage, followed by a very fast '3 Warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over. 

Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, "Tempest". While the design of the alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also-legendary "Galaga" series.

- TRIVIA -

Gyruss was released in March 1983 in Japan.

After working on the successful "Time Pilot", Gyruss' designer, Yoshiki Okamoto, went on to create Gyruss, which, although a success in its own right, was released at a time when the arcade craze was starting to die down. This may explain why the game didn't shift the units it really deserved. After its release, Okamoto asked for a raise, or he would quit. He was duly fired when he turned up for work the following day. 

One of the most memorable features of this game is its soundtrack, which consists of an extremely catchy synthesized rendition of Bach's 'Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor'. 

Anthony Fodrizio holds the official record for this game with 41,090,450 points. 

A set of developer credits are hidden in the ROM, beginning at 1E9A in memory.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Venus". 

Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-85) on June 25, 1986.

A Gyruss unit appears in the music video for "Kid Candy" by the grunge rock group Seaweed.

- SCORING -

Shooting a ship: 50, 100 or 150 points. 
Destroying a whole formation of enemy ships before the next wave attacks: 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500 points. 
Bonus for clearing a sector (having not destroyed a whole formation): 1,000 points. 
Shooting the three glowing spheres: 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 points. 
Bonus for shooting each ship on the Chance Stage: 100 points. 
Bonus for shooting all 40 ships on the Chance Stage: 10,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* You can get double fire if you shoot the sun-like enemy that appears in front of you surrounded by two blue pod-like enemies - try to make this a priority.

* To make getting double fire easier, try to stay at the bottom of the screen until the 'pod and sun' formation appears as it will appear right in front of wherever your ship is after all enemies have entered and they start attacking. 
1) There must be at least three enemies left in the level for the 'pod and sun' formation to show. If you lose a life and three enemies are left, the 'pod and sun' will show up one more time, but if you lose a life after that, they will not show any more until the next level. After you get double fire, the sun enemy will be replaced on later levels with another pod. Destroy all three for some bonus points.
2) If you have only one enemy left and cannot seem to destroy it, just leave it alone and eventually it will just leave and the level will end.

* Each level begins with four formations entering. If you destroy enough of these, a fifth formation will enter. As you pass each planet, more formations will enter towards the top of the screen. Learn to control your ship at the top as it will come in real handy on those Mars and Earth warps.

* When formations enter from the edge of the screen, they will not hit you if you are right where they enter. You can use this to your advantage to take out the formation with little or no trouble - just watch out for asteroids.

* Asteroids will always appear in your path - they cannot be destroyed and must be avoided.

* The 'bee-like' creatures with the force field will always appear from the center and move outward. The force field will destroy your ship if you touch it. Destroy one of the creatures to disable their force field.

* Learn the formations of the enemy attack waves during the normal stages, to enable you to collect the bonuses for destroying whole waves of attacking ships.

* Learn the formations of the enemy attack waves during the chance stages, to enable you to collect the bonuses for destroying whole waves of attackers and the 10,000 for destroying all 40 ships.

* The three glowing spheres always appear aligned with where you are located on screen. Remember to avoid any bullets when they appear.

* You can fire bullets ahead of enemy ships and then move aside to destroy them and avoid their shots.

Joust (c) 1982 Williams.

Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. 

The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. 

A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. 

Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. 

Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level.

- TECHNICAL -

* The upright version of Joust was a dedicated cabinet. It is similar in shape to other Williams games from that era, but it is not identical to them. The cabinet is largely black with no painted art on the front of the machine. But it does have sideart, in this case a four-color painted rendering of a knight riding a large bird, while carrying a lance. This design is fairly simple when compared to the sideart on other games, and can be repainted by hand, as long as you are careful. The control panel, monitor bezel, and marquee are all filled with the expected graphics. The marquee especially is a stunning rendition of the Joust logo, and two riders inside the Joust world. Your Joust machine will come with either 2-way leaf switch joysticks, or 2-way optical ones. The early cabinets had the optical ones, while the later ones used the leaf stick ones. 

* The cocktail version (a cocktail game is a sit down table version), is notable because it was one of the most popular cocktail cabinets for conversion to newer titles. You see most cocktail tables originally held games that had monitors in a vertical orientation, and had a set of player controls on each end of the table. By 1985 no one was really making many vertical games, especially not ones that were one player at a time, and could flip the screen for the second player. But the Joust table was different. It had a horizontal monitor, and the players sat side by side, instead of at opposite ends of the table. This allowed the Joust cocktail cabinet to be used for all sorts of newer games. Electronically the cocktail version of Joust was identical to the upright version. The cocktail cabinet did not feature a lot of art, and was mostly black.

The Joust PCBs are functionally identical to those used in "Defender", "Robotron - 2084", "Bubbles", "Sinistar", and "Stargate", only the ROM chips are different.

- TRIVIA -

Joust was released in September 1982 in the USA.

The name of this game is a reference for 'Jousting'. Jousting is a competition between two knights on horse-back, wherein each knight tries to knock the other off his mount. Jousting was popular in medieval times. 

Joust shares some sounds from "Defender" and "Stargate". 

James Vollandt holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 107,216,700 points. 
Don Morlan holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 1,002,500 points. 

A Joust unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'. 

A Joust unit appears (multiple times) in a 'Columbo' tv movie episode: (Murder, Smoke and Shadows) directed by James Frawley.

- UPDATES -

Red version has a default high score of 107,212 points, Green and Yellow versions have 109,102 points as the default high score. Also, the Green version fixes a well known bug that allowed you to endlessly kill Pterodactyls on certain levels, thus achieving incredible scores.

- SCORING -

Killing enemies: 
Bounder (Red): 500 points. 
Hunter (Silver/Gray): 750 points. 
Shadow Lord (Blue): 1,000 points. 
Pterodactyl: 1,000 points.

Not dying during a Survival Wave: 3,000 points. 

If neither player kills the other during a Team Wave (2-player game only): 3,000 points for each player. 

The first player who kills the other player during a Gladiator Wave (2-player game only): 3,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your man will be at the entry point at the bottom of the playing field. From the other entry points, enemy riders will appear. It will then be up to you to successfully defeat them. Learning to flap your ostrich's wings is the most vital aspect of this game. How fast or slow you flap the wings determines speed and maneuverability. Once you get good, you will be able to glide around and only flap for either altitude or to hit an enemy rider.

* The name of the game is height. Whoever is the higher rider during a joust is the winner. If you and an enemy collide on the same level, the impact will knock you both backwards a little and turn you both around. This can prove to be dangerous if more then one enemy is coming for you since the first one turns you around and the second knocks you off your mount.

* You need to pay particular attention to the screen setup on each wave. Different platforms may collapse forcing you to readjust your strategy accordingly. Using the 20-wave example from Chapter 6.4, I will give you some basic strategies...
a) During the non-pterodactyl waves and platform one is intact, your best bet is to hang out under the right side of platform one. The enemy riders have to drop to get to you.  Just a quick press of the flap button should give you altitude over them and the easy kill.
b) If you lose platform one, the next best place is platform five. This forces the enemy riders to rise up to you. If you hover over the left or right edge, you can drop on enemy riders trying to rise up from the areas of platforms two and three. Of course, if any make it to your level, just sit on that entry point. When an enemy rider gets near, rapidly climb and move over toward the enemy to knock them off their mount.
c) When you only have platforms two and three, you will use a modified strategy from the one above. You will hover around the area that platform five was at. This forces the enemy riders to rise up to you, thereby exposing themselves to you dropping down on them.
d) If any of the above have Shadow Lords in them, you will have to be prepared to move around quickly since Shadow Lords are very fast and they tend to bounce off the top of the game screen.

* There are a couple of ways to kill off the pterodactyl during the pterodactyl waves:
1) First of all, you must be facing the pterodactyl in order to kill it.
2) If platform one still exists, then just wait for the pterodactyl and be ready for it to choke itself on your lance. If there are multiple pterodactyls, they usually come from opposite sides so the first one will have you turned around to meet the second one.
3) If platform one is gone, they use platform two to do your prehistoric hunting. If there are multiple pterodactyls, then you will have to move around until the second and subsequent pterodactyls are coming at your rider head on while you sit atop platform two.
4) If you are real good, you can kill the pterodactyls off in the air. You just have to make sure that your lance is evenly aligned with the pterodactyls mouth.
5) Pterodactyls also show up if you take too long on a wave. These can't be killed using the platform method. The only way is either in the air or to lose a man.
6) Some players take out all the enemy riders but one. Then they lead this rider toward the lave so the Lava Troll can grab them. The player then sits and hunts pterodactyls. This is a long process that is definitely loaded with peril.
7) If you get killed before killing the pterodactyl, it is very hard to get in position to kill the pterodactyl since it does involve a sort of rhythm. Also keep in mind that the enemy riders will still be trying to dismount you as you are hunting.

* The Pterodactyl Trick: Classic trick! Doesn't work on upgraded Joust machines, or on "Joust 2". Trick the last jouster on the stage to fly to the lava and get trapped by the lava troll. Then wait in the center of the middle platform. When a pterodactyl comes out, it'll fly right into your lance. The next part takes a fair amount of practice: When the pterodactyl has hit you, your character will be knocked back. Jiggle the joystick so that your mount is back in the middle of the ledge again. Keep doing this. Eventually there'll be a steady stream of pterodactyls and you'll be killing 'em about two per second, for 1,000 points each. When you make a mistake and get killed, the trapped jouster will escape. On the last board in which this works (47), the jouster will not escape.

* The Lava Troll hazard isn't too major unless you fly too close to the surface of the lava. If you do happen to get grabbed, flap rapidly to escape.  It is also easy to hit enemies immobilized by the troll.

* After you hit an enemy rider, they become an egg. After a few seconds, the egg will hatch to the next hardest enemy rider. For example, a Bounder becomes a Hunter; a Hunter becomes a Shadow Lord. After that, it will always be a Shadow Lord. Some players leave one egg and then hover over it. When the enemy buzzard comes to pick up the rider, you knock him off the saddle again and collect the points. Again, the pterodactyl will show up soon to end this fun.

* Make sure you don't knock too many enemy riders off at once or there will be eggs scattered all over the place. This makes it hard to keep the enemy population down to a dull roar.

* Whenever your rider gets killed, he will appear at the entrance point all shimmery. If you let the sequence go, it will take up to five seconds for your rider to appear. During that time, he is immune to all attacks. Your rider will enter at the point there is the least amount of enemies. This is usually the very bottom platform. Keep in mind, the enemies also enter at these points.

* The game does reach a point where there are so many enemy riders running around, they are constantly bumping into one another. This, in effect, creates a wall which is very difficult and hazardous to navigate through. This means you have to split up the enemy

* If you die during a wave, try quickly to get your bearings so that you can get in position to continue depleting the enemy forces.

* The above tips are as valid for the two-player game as they are for the one-player game. In the two-player game, though, you and the other player can cover each other to make it more difficult for the enemy to knock you off your mounts.

* Phantom Energizer: In a two-player game (on a screen just before the middle ledge disappears) clear all opponents except one. Kill him, leaving the egg in the middle of the bottom platform. Player 1 stands on the bottom energizer while player 2 jumps in the lava. If player 2 appears on the top energizer, then the trick will work. Player 1 then gets the egg. The 'phantom' ledge should remain.

Kangaroo (c) 1982 Sun Electronics.

A platform game in which the player controls a mother Kangaroo who must climb through the treetops trying to rescue her captured son. Numerous monkeys, the kidnappers of her child, roam the levels set on stopping the player's progress. The monkeys constantly throw apples at the Kangaroo which must either be avoided (either by ducking or jumping, depending on the height of the approaching apple), or punched away, the latter of which allows the Kangaroo to punch the apple back towards the attacking monkey.

If the player stalls for too long or does not punch either an apple or a monkey, a giant ape will appear and steal the Kangaroo's boxing gloves, leaving the player temporarily defenseless. The gloves are returned after a short time.

Fruit and vegetables litter the levels and can be picked up for bonus points. Each level also has a bell hanging from one of its platforms, which can be punched to make fruit and vegetable items appear. The game consists of 4 different stages, once these are completed the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 39 years ago:

Krull (c) 1983 Gottlieb.

The left joystick controls the movement of the player character, Colwyn. He can be moved in any one of eight directions. The right joystick controls the movement of the player's weapon, the glaive. It can be thrown in any one of eight directions. Four glaives can be in flight at one time and will return to Colwyn with a boomerang-type action. The one and two player select buttons are also located on the panel.

Krull consists of five subgames:
1. The Mountain Game.
2. The Swamp Game.
3. The Fortress Game.
4. The Hexagon Game.
5. The Beast Game.

The player must accomplish a task in each of the five games with eight levels of difficulty in each. All eight levels can be reached in one task based on the time spent performing that task (amount of time spent on that subgame). The total number of lethal characters on the screen at one time increases as the levels increase.

FROM THE SKY WILL COME THE BLACK FORTRESS. FROM THE FORTRESS WILL COME THE SLAYERS, TO DEVOUR THE PLANET OF KRULL. THEN SHALL A GIRL OF ANCIENT NAME BECOME QUEEN, AND THE KING SHE CHOOSES SHALL RULE THE PLANET.

The planet Krull is threatened by the Beast. His army of Slayers has brought terror to the land. Colwyn must stop this terror and save the land and its people. On the day Colwyn is to wed the Princess Lyssa, the Slayers, army of the Beast, kidnap her to become the Beast's bride. Colwyn must reach the Black Fortress and reclaim his Princess. He who marries the Princess shall be king. The Beast must not be allowed to rule the planet.

A prophet acquaints Colwyn with the magical properties of the glaive, a five-bladed sword, which Colwyn must acquire. To accomplish this task, he must climb the mountain and collect the five individual blades of the glaive in order to assemble the weapon. The blade is picked up by touching Colwyn to the blade. Boulders are fatal and must be avoided. The weapon joystick is not utilized in this subgame. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each blade picked up. Points are also awarded for placing Colwyn in a dangerous position in front of one or more boulders.

During his travels to discover the Black Fortress, Colwyn comes upon an army of eight men that he befriends and recruits to help him in his quest to destroy the Beast so that Krull can be safe from his evil.

With no intentions of losing his newly acquired bride without bloodshed, the Beast orders an army of Slayers to stop Colwyn and his friends. Forging through the quicksand-riddled swamps, Slayers materialize from the soil and Colwyn prepares for battle. In the second subgame, Colwyn must save as many friends as possible while killing all of the Slayers. The friends are saved by touching them and the Slayers are destroyed by the glaive. The Slayers themselves and their spears must be avoided. The game begins with eight friends. The number of friends saved is the number of friends carried over into future subgames. The friends can eliminate the Slayers with hand-to-hand combat but can also be destroyed themselves. Receiving three blows either by hand-to-hand or by the Slayers spear is fatal to the friends. The subgame ends when there are no longer any friends to save and all of the Slayers have been eliminated. Avoid quicksand, as it slows Colwyn's attack. Each friend saved awards 1,000 points (maximum 8,000 points) and 100 points for each Slayer the player eliminates.

After days of travel, Colwyn and his men have found the Black Fortress in the Iron Desert where many dangers await them. While attempting to lead his men through the dangerous narrow passageways that lead to the Fortress, Slayers materialize once again in a second attempt to stop Colwyn's struggle. In this third subgame, Colwyn must pick up all of his friends and deposit them safely into the hexagon while again combating the Slayers. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2. This subgame concludes when all of the friends have been delivered to the hexagon. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each friend delivered to the hexagon, 100 points for each Slayer he destroys and 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the last friend is delivered to the hexagon.

Victorious in battle, Colwyn must now attempt to release his friends from the hexagon. Unlike entry, exiting the hexagon is a struggle deservant of its own merit. Once again Colwyn must call upon the power of the glaive. Release of his friends is accomplished by throwing the glaive at the front wall while it is black only. Any glaive striking the wall while it is not black will stick in the wall until the wall becomes black. The Slayers, of course, attempt to stop Colwyn's efforts. In his own attempt for survival, Colwyn must fight them off and avoid their spears. The subgame ends when the last black wall is broken through and the friends have escaped. The player is awarded 100 points for each Slayer he puts an end to, 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the friends are set free and 1,000 points for the first black wall destroyed, 2,000 points for the second, 3,000 points for the third and 4,000 points for the fourth.

Now inside the Black Fortress, Colwyn secedes from his friends in order to rescue the Princess Lyssa. He finds her in a large cave carefully guarded by the Beast. He knows that the only way to reclaim his bride and conserve the planet is to forge into battle with the Beast. In the fifth subgame, the player moves Colwyn towards the Princess in order to reach her. As he progresses, the Beast attempts to stop him by throwing fireballs at him. The fireballs must be avoided or destroyed by the glaive. If not destroyed, the fireballs will ricochet off of the walls. Destroying a fireball awards the player 100 points multiplied by the number of fireballs in flight. The Beast is momentarily stunned when hit with a glaive and awards the player 100 points. The Beast cannot be destroyed and the player must avoid touching him. When Colwyn reaches the Princess, his friends, following the pandemonium of the battle, appear and chase the Beast off, awarding 1000 points per friend. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2.

- TRIVIA -

Krull was released in March 1983.

this game is known in Japan as "Ginga Densetsu Krull" (translates from Japanese as 'Galactic Legend Krull').

Krull was designed and programmed in 10 months. Chris and Matt started on it in early May of 1982 and finished in February of 1983. It is Gottlieb's first movie-themed video game.

Jason Curran holds the official record for this game with 421,590 points.

About the movie: Krull is a world deep in a far-away galaxy, a culture of myth and magic. The kingdoms of Krull, in the past divided by wars, have united to battle the terrible enemy who seeks to dominate them... the Beast. He is a powerful dark force who has returned from Krull's ancient past, determined to destroy all those who oppose him. 
Krull is a $25 million dollar fantasy adventure from Columbia Pictures. To create this special-effect epic, Columbia Pictures has assembled the industry's top talent, people who helped bring Superman and The Empire Strikes Back to the screen. Like those top-grossing films, Krull will appeal primarily to young people under age 25, the most important demographic group for game operators.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Pengo (c) 1982 Sega.

Pengo is an action game set in an overhead maze constructed of ice blocks. The player controls Pengo, a red penguin that lives in the Antarctic and fights the blob-like Sno-Bees. The objective of the game is for Pengo to survive a series of rounds by eliminating all Sno-Bees, while amassing bonuses by bringing together the three diamonds dispersed in the maze.

The Maze itself is an interactive environment. Each section of wall is a block of ice that can be pushed onto the Sno-bees to destroy them. Pressing the button while pushing the joystick will cause Pengo to push the ice block in the direction he is facing. The block will slide until it hits either a wall or another ice block, crushing any Sno-Bees in its path. Crushing more than one Sno-Bee at once will increase the number of points awarded.

As the player crushes the Sno-Bees, new ones hatch from eggs located within ice blocks. At the start of each level, blocks that contain these eggs are briefly identified by flashing the colour of that level's Sno-Bees. Eggs can be eliminated by crushing the ice blocks that contain them. If Pengo pushes a side wall at the edge of the screen, the water vibrates, any adjacent Sno-Bees will be briefly stunned and are eliminated if Pengo walks over them in this state. 

The Sno-bees themselves will destroy the ice blocks as they move around each level, so speed is of the essence. Some of the blocks are 'Diamond blocks' which cannot be destroyed but can be re-used by Pengo. 

After 60 seconds elapse in a round without a player or enemy death, the game enters into sudden death mode; the music tempo and movement of the Sno-Bees accelerates. If a single Sno-Bee remains in the round, a jingle plays and the Sno-Bee accelerates in an attempt to reach a corner, where it safely fades away.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Penta".

- UPDATES -

Set 2 &amp; 4 draws its maze much more quickly and has snappy original music, whereas Set 1 &amp; 3's music is a copy of an instrumental pop song (Hot Butter - Popcorn - 1972).

Set 2, 3, 4 correct a Test Menu Bug.

The curtain speed is fastest on Set 2.

The demo mode is different in Set 2.

Set 4 introduced a number of changes to make the game flow faster than in previous sets.
- Number of frames before the level completion time is shown changed from 32 to 8.
- Number of frames after a time bonus is calculated changed from 128 to 64.
- Number of frames before the screen wipes after the player has died changed from 128 to a single frame.

Additional changes were made in Set 2:
- Delay before player can move at the start of a stage changed from 64 frames to 16 frames.
- Delay before the next level loads after an intermission changed from 64 frames to 16 frames.
- Delay before the sky rapidly changes colors in the intro changed from 64 frames to 48 frames.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The last remaining Sno-Bee on the screen will try to escape. If you do not kill it before it reaches one of the corners it will disappear.

* The indicator at the top of the screen tells you how many Sno-Bees are remaining on the level, including those still in ice blocks.

* At the start of each level some ice blocks will flash. This indicates that there is a Sno-Bee inside and you can destroy the ice block to kill the Sno-Bee before it emerges.

* When you kill the last Sno-Bee you have a couple of seconds to crush up to four ice blocks for an extra 30 points each.

* Concentrate your efforts on lining up the diamond blocks. The 10000 points are the biggest single score in the game, and stunning all the Sno-Bees is also a valuable side effect. You can then kill them easily by pushing ice blocks onto them rather than running over them (400 points as opposed to 100).

* Lining up the three diamond have another side effect: the remaining ice blocks with a Sno-Bee inside will be flash to the end of screen.

* Try to kill more than one Sno-Bee at a time, as two or more together are worth more points than killing them individually.

* Easter Egg: In the attract mode, push the two joys to up, press the two action buttons and one button of start game, and it will show the credits of the game. After a few seconds, the game will reset. The wait can be stopped pushing the 1P Start button.

Phoenix (c) 1980 Amstar.

Phoenix is a classic vertical shoot-em-up in the mould of Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Galaxian", but takes the concept further with the introduction of progressive stages of play (instead of simply repeating a single playfield over and over with an increasing difficulty level). 

The player pilots a lone ship that can only move left and right along the botton of the playfield and fire upwards. The ship can also utilize a temporary 'Force Field' to protect it from missiles and birds. Any birds that that collide with the Force Field are destroyed. The Force Field only lasts for two seconds, but then cannot be used again for another five seconds. 

There are five attack waves to each round of play. 

The first wave begins with a formation of sixteen birds attacking the player's ship. They drop missiles and dive at the ship in an effort to destroy it. 

The second wave is a variation of the first, only with a different enemy attack pattern. 

The third wave begins with pattern of eight eggs that hatch into blue Phoenix birds that then attack the player's ship. These birds can be destroyed by rocket fire from the ship. If the rocket hits the bird on center, the bird is destroyed. If the rocket hits the bird to the left or right of center, only that wing of the bird is destroyed. The wing will regenerate itself if the bird is not quickly destroyed. 

The fourth wave is similar to the third, only with two banks of eggs instead of one. 

The fifth and final wave is the attack of the Space fortress mothership; a huge mothership piloted by a purple-coloured Alien Queen who sends down waves of small birds to attack the player's ship, as well as launching missiles from the mothership itself. The Alien Queen is protected by a barrier that must be shot several times before both the Queen and the mothership are destroyed.

Once the mothership has been destroyed, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

The additional gameplay elements seem to be at the expense of hardware performance. Despite having more basic graphics than "Galaxian", Phoenix's ships move in a very mechanical fashion compared to the smooth, nicely animated movements of Namco's classic.

- TECHNICAL -

Most Phoenix games will be in a standard Centuri woodgrain cabinet, but several other cabinets exist, due to this game being sold by multiple companies at the same time. These use sticker sideart (which covers the upper half of the machine), and glass marquees. The control panel is made up entirely of buttons, no joysticks are present (on the upright and 'maxi' cabs, that is; the cocktail cab has a 2-way joystick and 2 buttons). The monitor in this machine is mounted vertically, and the monitor bezel is relatively unadorned. Phoenix uses a unique wiring harness, which isn't know to be compatible with any other games.

- TRIVIA -

Titlescreen's copyright notice:
PHOENIX COPYRIGHT 1980
AMSTAR ELECTRONICS CORP.
PHOENIX AZ. U.S.A.

Phoenix was released in December 1980.

Phoenix was the first multi-level space shooter and also the first shooter to include bosses. Despite its hardware issues, Phoenix's many gameplay innovations ensured that it now is rightly regarded as a classic and, along with Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Pac-Man" shares the dubious honour of being one of the most cloned games of the 1980s; with numerous console and home computer 'tributes' appearing.

The song that is played at the start of the game is 'Romance de Amor', also known as 'Spanish Romance', whose true author is currently unknown.

The song that is played when you start over after the mothership is destroyed is Ludwig van Beethoven's 'F√ºr Elise'.

Mark Gotfraind holds the official record for this game with 987,620 points.

- SCORING -

Scoring is a little complicated in this game due to the fact it depends on hits made and how close the Phoenix's are to your fighter.

Phoenix fighters: 20, 40, or 80 points; 200 points if flying as a bird.
Phoenix birds: 50 or 100 points/egg, 100 - 800 points/bird (depends on how many wings shot off and distance from fighter).
Mothership: 1,000 - 9,000 points (may depend on how close the mothership is to you fighter when you kill the Alien Queen; may also depend on the amount of damage to the mothership, speed of destruction, as well as the number of spaceships destroyed). Usually, first 9 spaceships would increase by a thousand, then will be followed by nine 9000 point spaceships, then back to the first nine set, etc...

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You will see a formation of enemy fighters at the top of the screen. This is the beginning of Wave 1. A quick note about the Force Field: it lasts a couple of seconds and takes about five seconds to regenerate again.

WAVES 1 AND 2:
1) You will usually be attacked by multiple fighters at any one time. The movements of these fighters is pretty random.
2) In addition to dropping bombs on your fighter, Phoenix fighters also tend to try to ram your fighter.
3) After you clear out a few fighters, they will reassemble at the top of the screen. They will then move in synch with each other as they creep to the bottom of the screen.
4) Sometimes a Phoenix fighter will hover right above your ship. If you're quick, you can get off a quick shot and move away before a bomb can be dropped on you.
5) If multiple Phoenix fighters are at your level, use the Force Field to clear a path through them.

WAVE 3 AND 4:
1) The Phoenixes in Wave 3 enter the screen in a zig-zag pattern while the Phoenixes in Wave 4 arrive in a cross-over pattern of four Phoenixes per side.
2) Once they get large, they start to do erratic zig-zag patterns across the screen. At the same time, they are dropping bombs toward your fighter. Your goal is to shoot off their wings. If you do this, it forces them to go straight down until the wing regenerates. They will still be dropping bombs, but at least they will be going straight down.
3) If at all possible, try to hit the Phoenixes when they are close to your ship. Doing this gets you more points.
4) In addition, try to shoot off both wings before destroying a Phoenix for more points.

WAVE 5:
1) Your goal on this wave is to cut through the mothership's hull and shield and take out the Alien Queen inside.
2) Start firing as rapidly as you can to quickly cut through the hull. It will take quite a few shots to get to the shield.
3) The shield rotates so you will have to hit it a lot of times in order to get a wide enough hole in it to hit the Alien Queen.
4) As all of this is going on, the mothership is continually descending upon your ship. In addition, the escorts are constantly harassing you.
5) A good strategy is that once you have cut a path through the hull and shield, wait for the mothership to be almost on top of your ship. When you take out the alien, you will get a lot more points.
6) Destroying the escorts does not end this wave. Once you complete Wave 5, the cycle begins anew.

* During the game three birds will attack all in a line. Let those birds fly all the way to the bottom and start to fly back up. As they are flying up, shoot all three in a row real quick (2 or 3 seconds) and you will elevate your score to 204,000 regardless of what your current score is - The best way to get this bonus for shooting the three birds in a line is on the second stage of level 2. The blue and pink birds in an oval shape. Just wait, not firing at the bottom of the screen. A single bird will come down, fanny around and then fly back up, then four birds will fly down together in a line. When they start to fly back up - blast three of them for the bonus. It works best here because of the rapid fire allowed on this and every other 2nd stage. In addition, accomplishing the trick a second time again puts your score at 204,000, even if your score was higher.

Polaris (c) 1980 Taito.

Polaris is a 1-player, single screen shoot-em-up, baring many similarities to Taito's most famous shoot-em-up, "Space Invaders", in which a player takes on the role of Commander of a Polaris class nuclear submarine. War has been declared and the Polaris' mission is to defend the country from enemy attack.

In battle, players must defend against wave after wave of enemy planes (fighter jets and missile-dropping bi-planes) as well as enemy subs and destroyers. Players must also be careful to avoid the many mines and depth charges that litter the ocean.

Pooyan (c) 1982 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

The player takes on the role of a bow-and-arrow welding pig who must protect her piglets from the pack of hungry wolves ballooning up or down the cliff face. The pig is suspended in a winch-controlled cage and must move vertically up and down, shooting the balloons and sending the wolves plummeting to the ground. Any wolves she misses will, having safely reached the ground, climb a ladder to try and bite her. Also, if any of the wolves reach the ground, more piglets will be captured by them. Mother Pig must try to kill as many wolves as possible without letting them reach the ground.

On the second level, the wolves use balloons to float upwards to the top of a high cliff. If enough of them reach the cliff, they will push a huge boulder down onto Mother Pig's cage. After this level has been completed, the piglets who have been captured are rescued and the game starts over with increased difficulty.

There is also a bonus round where Mother Pig will attempt to eliminate as many wolves on ascending balloons as possible by throwing as few slabs of meat as possible for a maximum bonus score.

Pooyan was released in October 1982 in Japan.

The title is Japanese for 'little pigs'. It is also very rarely used as an adjective meaning 'extremely stupid'. For example, 'Intentionally puncturing your spacesuit is pooyan'. 

The intro tune is a rendition of "The Other Day I Met a Bear" which is a traditional American camp song. The music was composed in 1919 by Carey Morgan and Lee David.

The Round 1 in-game tune is a rendition of 'Humoresque (Op. 101, No. 7 in G flat major)' by Antonin Dvorak. 

Mark Kinter holds the official record for this game with 1609250 points. 

A bootleg of this game is known as "Pootan". 

A Pooyan unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Learn how a meat piece falls: unlike arrows, meat pieces fly not straight but in an arc.

* Throw meat pieces at enemy formations: When arrows are not enough to take out a formation, use meat pieces to wipe them all out. Knowing how a meat piece falls will work in your advantage.

* When to use meat pieces ?: At the end of a level appears a wolf with a balloon hard to pop. Keep the meat piece until the very end and use it against that particular wolf.

* Do not underestimate the power of the balloon: As the game proceeds, there will be balloons with no wolves holding onto them. While it will not count as a miss even if you don't take out these balloons, they bounce off meat pieces. be careful!

* Shoot down rocks with arrows: Rocks thrown by wolves can be reflected with the roof of MAM's gondola and by shooting arrows. Stay calm even if you see a bunch of rocks coming at you.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Popeye (c) 1982 Nintendo.

Popeye is a platform game featuring characters from the famous King Features Syndicate cartoon show of the same name. The aim of the game is to rescue Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. This is achieved by catching a set number of objects thrown down by Olive from the top of the screen; such as hearts, letters and musical notes. Popeye is constantly pursued in his quest by love rival, Brutus (originally known as Bluto). Popeye must either run away from Brutus or grab some spinach and punch him off the screen (he will, of course, return).

Should any of Olive Oyl's items fail to be caught, they will fall into the water at the bottom of the screen. Popeye will then have only a few seconds to retrieve the object or a life is lost. Several other Popeye characters also make an appearance in the game; namely Wimpy, Swee'Pea, the Sea Hag, and her vulture Bernard. The game's three levels are the dock scene, the street scene and the shipboard scene. These repeat with increasing difficulty.

- TECHNICAL -

Most Popeye machines were upright cabinets, but cocktails were also available. The upright was in the standard Nintendo cabinet, the same one used in "Donkey Kong", "Donkey Kong Jr.", "Radar Scope", "Donkey Kong 3", and "Sky Skipper". Almost all other Nintendo titles used alternate versions of this same cabinet. "Mario Bros." was wider, "Punch-Out!!" was taller, etc., but they were still nearly identical. A dedicated Popeye machine will be blue, although you will sometimes see them in different colors (non-blue Popeyes are conversion cabinets).

* Popeye From Strip To Screen:
Popeye the Sailor, one of the most enduring characters in animation history, began not in motion pictures but in E.C. 'Elzie' Segar's 'Thimble Theater' comic strip. Born in Illinois, Segar began cartooning in Chicago in 1914. Graduating to his own strip for the Chicago American, Segar was then hired in 1919 by Hearst's New York Evening Journal to create the syndicated 'Thimble Theater' strip. 'Thimble Theater' depicted the adventures of Ham Gravy, his girlfriend Olive Oyl and her brother Castor. The venture was a success, expanding to an additional Sunday color page in 1924. Segar's comic strip used complex, rambling and frequently eerie narratives that attracted a devoted following, but it lacked strong central characters. In the 'Thimble Theater' of January 17, 1929, Ham and Castor decided to hire a crew to sail in search of the legendary Whiffle Hen. Walking up to a grizzled one-eyed mariner on a dock, Castor asked him, "Are you a sailor?" "`Ja think I'm a cowboy?" came the reply, introducing Popeye to readers.

* Move Over, Ham Gravy:
Over a period of months, Popeye developed from a supporting character to the central figure in the hunt for the Whiffle Hen. When Segar finally brought the narrative to a close and tried to retire the sailor, outraged fans contacted the Hearst syndicate demanding more adventures with Popeye. Segar obliged them: the sailor replaced Ham as Olive's love interest, Castor Oyl was reduced to infrequent appearances, and the strip was renamed 'Thimble Theater, Starring Popeye'.

The early 1930s was a period of keen competition among American animation studios for market share. Central to the business strategy of most studios was the development of cartoon 'stars' whose popularity would ensure bookings by major theater chains. Disney followed the success of Mickey Mouse by developing new characters like Donald Duck and Goofy up from supporting roles in Mickey Mouse cartoons. Similar strategies were tried at Warner Bros., where Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck evolved from secondary roles in films starring other animated characters. One of the earliest examples of this took place at the Fleischer Studios, Inc. in New York, where the unpopular starring canine character Bimbo was matched up with a girlfriend in Dizzy Dishes (1930). The girlfriend eventually developed into Betty Boop, the studio's major character. With the popularity of Betty Boop at a peak in 1932, brothers Max and Dave Fleischer decided to introduce a new film series which would include another character to grow into a star. Fleischer rival Van Beuren Corporation had already signed an agreement to bring Otto Soglow's strip 'The Little King' to the screen. Max Fleischer, who was a great fan of Segar's strip, approached Hearst's King Features Syndicate for the right to use Popeye. The two companies signed an agreement on November 17, 1932.

* Betty introduces Popeye to the Big Screen:
The production of the first Popeye film took place in secrecy. Veteran animator Roland Crandall was given space apart from the rest of the studio. There, he single-handedly animated the entire cartoon, aided only by the inclusion of some Shamus Culhane animation recycled from the earlier Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle (1932). The results were so satisfying that even before the film was released, the Fleischers and King Features amended the agreement granting the studio the right to produce and release animated cartoons featuring Popeye for a five year period.

Crandall's film 'Betty Boop Presents Popeye The Sailor' opened in the summer of 1933 as part of the 'Betty Boop' series. After a prologue in which newspapers herald the sailor's film debut, and Popeye sings 'I'm Popeye the Sailor Man', the film featured what was to be the standard 'Popeye' series plot, re-enacted with variations by the Fleischers for the next decade. Olive waits for Popeye to disembark from his ship at the dock. Bluto follows the couple to a fairground, where the two sailors compete for Olive's attentions through feats of strength. Bluto abducts Olive and ties her to a train track. As the locomotive approaches, Popeye and Bluto fight. Popeye defeats Bluto, and, through the magical powers of spinach, is able to stop the train and save Olive Oyl. Here, we see the essential difference between the Segar and Fleischer sense of narrative. Segar reveled in picaresque plots that coursed in unexpected directions for up to two years, exploring every novel twist and nuance of narrative. In anticipation of post-modernism, the very concept of plot was old-fashioned to the Fleischers. Hackneyed and ritualized story conventions were torn apart, recombined in odd juxtapositions, and satirized in endless variations.

The Fleischer Popeye cartoons were an instant success. "It might have been just a fluke, a lucky break, that the Segar characters fit the Fleischer style so well", recalls former Popeye animator Myron Waldman. "The animation of Olive Oyl in the mid-1930s was perfect. It fit her. The character had no elbows and the most prominent knees. When she spoke, the voice fit too. This was character. That's what made her so good".

* Step Aside, Mickey:
Segar's characters were not the only things consistent with the Fleischer style. Both Segar and the Fleischer staff shared a fondness for a poetically improvisational language. When Popeye's original voice artist, William 'Red Pepper Sam' Costello, left after the first few pictures, he was replaced by a studio in-between named Jack Mercer. Much of the dialogs of the Popeye cartoons was post-synched with little attention to synchronized mouth action. Mercer, Mae Questel (Olive's voice, except for the 1938-41 period, when Margie Hines was the voice artist) and William Penell or Gus Wickie, who voiced Bluto, often ad-libbed dialogs during recording sessions, particularly Popeye's 'asides' and pun-filled conversations. Added to this was a progressive softening and increased complexity of Popeye's character, paralleling changes in the strip. Popeye cartoons became the Fleischers' leading attraction. By 1938, Popeye replaced Mickey Mouse as the most popular cartoon character in America.

The Fleischers rummaged through the Segar strip for supporting characters. Bluto, the animated series' antagonist, was a minor character in the Segar strip, appearing only in 1933's 'The Eighth Sea'. Longer-lived strip characters that joined Popeye on the screen included hamburger maven J. Wellington Wimpy, Swee'Pea, Eugene the Jeep and Poopdeck Pappy. While in the comic strip, Popeye gained his great strength from rubbing the Whiffle Hen, the Fleischers added the gimmick of Popeye's power being largely dependent on the ingestion of spinach. Farmers in America's self-styled 'spinach capital' of Crystal City, Texas set up a statue of Popeye in gratitude for the publicity.

As early as 1935, the Fleischers sought backing for a feature-length animated film from their distributor Paramount. Paramount refused to risk money on a feature. In an attempt to persuade the company that longer animated films could be profitable, Max Fleischer initiated the production of three two-reel color 'specials' starring Popeye, beginning with 'Popeye The Sailor Meets Sinbad The Sailor' (1936). Although these 'specials' were often billed over their accompanying feature, Paramount still refused to back the animated feature.

Conditions changed after the success of Disney's 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs' (1937) and the Fleischers received money for the eighty minute Gulliver's Travels. According to some sources, the film was originally to have Popeye in the role of Gulliver, but the idea was scrapped early in the planning stages. Perhaps this was unwise. According to internal Paramount correspondence, the Popeye shorts were far more profitable to Paramount than Disney's films were to his distributor, RKO. The sailor's box-office appeal might have helped the Fleischer features. Gulliver's Travels (1938) and the company's next feature, Mr. Bug Goes To Town (1941), bombed, leading to the failure of Fleischer Studios, Inc.

* Post-Fleischer Popeye:
The successor company, Famous Studios, continued with the production of Popeye cartoons. Many of these were remakes of earlier Fleischer films. Much of the supporting cast of the Fleischer versions were replaced by new characters, such as identical nephews Pip-Eye, Peep-Eye, Poop-Eye and Pup-Eye. A redesign of the major characters included white U.S. Navy uniforms for Bluto and Popeye (in keeping with their war-time service in the armed forces), and more comely fashions for Olive. Upgraded technology, including the introduction of color to the series in 1943 with Her Honor The Mare and 3-D in Popeye The Ace Of Space (1953), tried to rejuvenate the series. None of these strategies were able to breathe much life into the films. Spooky Swabs (1957) brought theatrical release of Popeye films to a close.

The success of the black and white Popeye cartoons on television in the 1950s inspired several revivals of the series by such talents as Gene Deitch, John Halas and Joy Batchelor, Jack Kinney, and Hanna-Barbera. Hampered by limited budgets and rushed production schedules, none of these came close to the Fleischer or Famous theatrical versions. The less said about Robert Altman's live-action feature with Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall as Popeye and Olive Oyl, the better. What has endured are the original qualities of the Segar and Fleischer works. In fact, Segar's strips have been reissued by Nostalgia Press and the Smithsonian Press. The earlier Fleischer films, which shared the shabby urban or surreal exotic locations and working-class orientation of the Segar originals, retain a vitality and charm that still appeal to a large group of devoted fans today. 

* Bluto/Brutus issue:
Bluto's name was changed to Brutus after the theatrical Popeye cartoon series went out of production in 1957. It was wrongly believed that Paramount Pictures, distributors of the Fleisher Studios cartoon, owned the rights to the name Bluto. (King Features owned the name all along as Bluto had been originally created for the comic strip.) However, with poor research, they couldn't realize this, and renamed him Brutus to avoid copyright problems. "Brutus" appeared in the 1960-1962 Popeye television cartoons (with his physical appearance changed, making him obese rather than muscular), but he is again "Bluto" (and back to his original muscular physique) in the 1978 Hanna-Barbera Popeye series and the 1980 live-action Popeye movie, as well as the 1987 Popeye and Son series also by Hanna-Barbera. The character was named Bluto in the 2004 movie "Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy". Nintendo used the name "Brutus" for the character in this arcade game.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* A Display Glitch: On the street scene, you can stand at the point on the edge where you 'wraparound' and if you punch a bottle in the right spot, it'll erase part of the 'THRU' sign. This can be done on both sides.

* ROUND 1 - Dock Scene:
1) On this scene, Olive Oyl stands at the top of the screen and throw hearts (24 of them, one at a time) down to the bottom, hoping that Popeye will catch them all. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, you will have about 10 seconds to pick it up before it breaks, costing you one life. Try to catch the hearts as high as possible, since they decrease in value as they get closer to the bottom.

2) When Brutus harasses you, cross the edge of the screen from left to right and wait for him to stop directly underneath the bucket. Hit the punching bag at this point and the bucket will fall onto his head, rendering him helpless for a while. This will score you points based on which floor Brutus is on when you hit him (see Scoring above) and give you some time to catch a few more hearts.

3) Like in the cartoons, Popeye becomes stronger after eating Spinach. A can of Spinach moves between the second and third floors of the screen and you can have Popeye eat it by punching the can. Afterwards, Popeye will turn red and become stronger than Brutus for about 10 seconds (shorter in later levels). If you can punch Brutus during this time (you do not need to use the Punch button), he falls into the water, temporarily knocking him out, and you will be awarded 3,000 points.

4) Brutus will eventually recover so make good use of this time by catching as many falling hearts as possible. They don't move, and they are worth twice as much when Popeye is under the influence of Spinach, so catching some of the higher hearts can really help your score. And since extra lives are only awarded at a very high score (40,000 points by default on most machines, and 20,000 points by default on Revision F machines; see Updates above), you should be as greedy as possible.

5) Spinach can only be used once per level, and it is never restored after you lose a life (except in Revision F, see Updates above). Do not use it too soon. Collect about two thirds of the total number of hearts, and have as many hearts fill the air as possible before getting the Spinach.

6) If you want to risk getting 4,000 points instead of 2,000, do not use the punching bag immediately. Wait until you have knocked out Brutus using Spinach power, and position Popeye to the punching bag. After Brutus comes out of the sea, he will move underneath the bucket on the bottom floor. With some practice and timing you should be able to drop the bucket onto his head for 4,000 points. NOTE: Touching Brutus while the bucket is on his head is not fatal. But be careful, because after the bucket comes off he can easily knock out Popeye.

7) To make up for his lumbering slowness, Brutus is capable of throwing beer bottles at Popeye. You should try to force him to throw bottles as often as possible (four at a time) instead of avoiding them, so you can score extra points.

8) The Sea Hag also throws bottles, except she only throws one at a time. The Sea Hag materializes on the edge of the screen for a moment, chucks a bottle, and disappears. She can also be on both sides of the screen at once. So if you are caught between two Sea Hags or between Brutus and the Sea Hag, you will have to be quick on the joystick and the Punch button to survive. 

* ROUND 2 - Street Scene:
This scene is much like the dock scene, except Olive Oyl is now dropping musical notes (16 of them, one at a time). The major difference is the layout, with Wimpy on the plank in the lower left corner. If Popeye jumps off the second floor, he will be catapulted up to the third floor. With some careful timing, you can even make Popeye leap all the way up to the fourth floor, where Swee'Pea is waiting on a balloon platform. Touching the bottom of Swee'Pea's platform will score 500 points (1,000 points while under the influence of Spinach).

* ROUND 3 - Shipboard Scene: 
1) The setting for this scene is a ship, with a sliding platform on the top floor. The scene opens with Bernard, the Sea Hag's pet vulture, carrying Olive Oyl to the mast at the top. This intro is only shown the first time you play the shipboard scene.

2) To start the round, you should be able to slide Popeye across the moving platform on the fourth floor several times, catching the letters H-E-L-P that Olive Oyl is dropping from directly above.

3) Every time Popeye catches a letter, one step is added to a ladder which goes up to Olive Oyl. When the ladder is finished, Olive Oyl is rescued. This is the most difficult scene because a total of 24 letters are needed to complete the ladder and save Olive Oyl. Bernard will constantly appear from the left side of the screen. While sliding back and forth across the platform, you should try to punch Bernard as many times as possible, to score 1,000 points per punch.

4) After Popeye has rescued Olive Oyl on the shipboard scene, there will be an intermission that will have Popeye's face while "I'm Popeye The Sailor Man" plays followed by Popeye blowing his pipe and going "Toot! Toot!". Afterwards, the game begins again from the dock scene with increased difficulty.

On all three scenes, Brutus can reach from underneath or bend down from higher floors to lower ones. Be careful that you are not directly above or below him when he does this.

When the game restarts from the dock scene with increased difficulty, the Sea Hag will start throwing down deadly bouncing skulls from the edges of the screen that must be punched when they are bouncing upward. You must also make sure that there are no skulls directly above Popeye, since they drop down a floor or two and hit him on the head. The Sea Hag only throws skulls on the dock and street scenes, not on the shipboard scene.

Continue to avoid Brutus, Bernard, the beer bottles, and the skulls, and keep catching whatever Olive Oyl throws down.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Reactor (c) 1982 Gottlieb.

The player controls a cursor that can move freely within a screen-sized arena, the nuclear reactor. The center contains a sun-type gravitational power source, the slowly overheating reactor core. The surrounding wall or the sun, if touched results in death. The cursor is controlled with a trackball by the player, who has to roll it fast in one direction in order to overcome the momentum of gravitation imposed by the sun. Swarms of enemy objects named after various radioactive particles float around in the reactor arena, obeying simple physical laws. These enemies can freely bounce into the walls at low speeds, have a repulsive force against each other and actively attack the player cursor. Boss types often break up into several smaller particles.

The object is to survive the sun and walls while gaining the highest score possible. It takes a delicate touch. Rather than moving the cursor/avatar left, right, up and down as in many arcade games, it is controlled by gravity and moves freely; with the player only being able to accelerate it rather than control its movements directly. Meanwhile the enemy particles are getting so aggressive that it can get very difficult to avoid being pulled in by the sun or touching a wall.

The basic gameplay consists of accelerating the cursor just at the right times so that it circles the reactor core with enough speed to have control via its own momentum when the enemy particles try to knock it off course, and then to place decoys and actually use the acceleration of the ball itself to knock enemies into control rods, traps or the reactor core. By pressing the primary button the player cursor can go into high power mode, providing higher repulsion of enemies and conversely higher risk to the player.

To ease the task the player also has a certain number of decoys at their disposal. Pressing the secondary button places a decoy to attract the enemies, luring them into two traps in the corners of the screen for bonus points, into destroying reactor rods or directly into the walls to kill them. Destroying a row of reactor rods gives the player one more decoy, as well as resetting the size of the slowly swelling reactor core.

A time limit is enforced by the slowly swelling reactor core, which limits the space to move about in the arena. Although the reactor doesn't actually melt down, the decreasing space provides for gradually increasing difficulty. After defeating the first wave of enemies, the solid reactor core changes into Vortex core, unlike the Protect core, is lethal to touch (thus making such levels significantly harder).

- TRIVIA -

Reactor was released in July 1982. It was the first arcade game to credit the developer on the game's title screen.

First called 'Ram-It', then 'Expander', Reactor was Tim Skelly's first game design upon going independent. Skelly was one of the first independent game designers. He designed a number of games for Gottlieb (none of which were released) before taking an extended break in which he watched horror movies, drank margaritas and wrote a screenplay!

Approximately 1000 units were produced.

Stargate (c) 1981 Williams.

Stargate, also known as 'Defender II', will transport you to a whole new dimension in video games! Not only will the skills you learned with "Defender" be challenged and refined, but new strategies must come into play if you are to be victorious in rescuing the humanoids from the clutches of the aliens and in entering the Stargate! Your ability to react quickly and with on-target precision will be tested against the evil Yllabian Space Guppies, Dynamos, Space Hums, Firebombers and their Fireballs, Phreds, Big Reds and Munchies! If you succeed in maneuvering your ship into the Stargate, you'll be instantly trans-located to that part of the planet where the humanoids are being abducted! To open up spectacular scoring possibilities, rescue four Humanoids, re-enter Stargate and you'll warp 3 waves ahead in space and time, setting off dazzling special effects and racking up high points! 

If you must destroy everything in your path or risk self-destruction, activate the Inviso anti-matter cloaking device and become invisible and invulnerable! Inviso time plus a new ship and a Smart Bomb are earned with every 10,000 points you score! 

If all ten Humanoids in a wave are abducted, the universe will explode into smithereens, leaving deadly Mutants on the attack! Survive until Wave 5 and the universe will be restored, the humanoids safe... but you'll be the target of an Yllabian Dog Fight! There'll be no Landers to abduct the Humanoids, but all the other aliens will have stronger and larger forces concentrated against you! It will be an out space battle reaching the outer limits of aggression and will call up your last ounce of determination and courage!

- TRIVIA -

Stargate was released in October 1981 in the USA.

Stargate was the first game designed by Vid Kidz, the design firm founded by Jarvis and DeMar when they decided to go independent. Williams became desperate for a game after the designers left, so they took Vid Kidz under contract. Stargate took four months to complete. All Vid Kidz games were designed on a dual 8" floppy, 1 MHz 6809 Motorola Exorcisor system that cost $30,000 in those days.

The name was changed to 'Defender II' right after the game had stopped being manufactured, because Williams wanted to make sure they could own the trademark on the title. All compilation packs released for home consoles and computers in 1995 and later (see Ports section below for the complete listing) feature the game under the 'Defender II' moniker. 

The name of the enemy Yllabian is created by reversing the spelling of Bally, one of Williams' competitors. Bally reversed becomes Yllab. 

Shooting a Pod will release between four and seven Swarmers. 

Approximately 26,000 upright cabinets and about 1,000 cocktail tables were made. 

Stargate plays very similarly to "Defender", although several enhancements have been made to the already superb and demanding game play. Changes from "Defender": 
* The addition of eight more enemies. 
* The addition of the Stargate. Going through the Stargate allows the player to either: 
1) Go to the opposite side of the planet if no Humanoids are being threatened. 
2) Arrive at the exact spot where a Lander is abducting a Humanoid. 
3) In addition, before Wave 10, if you fly forwards (not backwards) through the Stargate while carrying four or more Humanoids, you will warp forward three waves. You will get a bonus of Humanoids left X 2,000 points for this achievement (up to 20,000 points). 
* The Inviso button allows you to cloak your ship in an anti-matter field. While cloaked, your ship is indestructible and you can destroy enemies by flying through them. You can still pick up falling Humanoids while cloaked. 
* There are now bonus waves in the game. After completing these bonus waves, you start again with ten Humanoids on the planet's surface. The bonus waves are: 
1) On Wave 5 and every tenth wave thereafter: The Yllabian Dogfight. 
2) On Wave 10 and every tenth wave thereafter: The Firebomber Showdown. 
* When the last Humanoid left on the planet's surface is abducted, the planet surface starts flashing, and the message under the scanner reads: 'PLANET SURFACE UNSTABLE!'. This is the warning that planetary explosion will occur soon unless at least one Humanoid is saved. 
* When all Landers in a wave are destroyed, the message under the scanner reads: 'ALL LANDERS DESTROYED!'. 
* There is now a 'Pod Intersection' timer which appears in the scanner at the beginning of any wave which has at least three Pods. It counts down to the moment when all the Pods come together.

- SCORING -

Lander: 150 points 
Mutant: 150 points 
Bomber: 250 points 
Pod: 1,000 points 
Baiter: 200 points 
Swarmer: 150 points 
Firebomber: 250 points 
Fireball: 100 points 
Dynamo: 200 points 
Space Hum: 100 points 
Yllabian Space Guppy: 200 points 
Phred: 200 points 
Big Red: 200 points 
Munchies: 50 points 
Getting hit by an enemy bullet: 25 points 

Destroying a Pod with a Smart Bomb will award either 1,450 or 1,600 points. 

Rescuing abducted Humanoids gives increasing bonuses if they are rescued consecutively without being immediately returned to the ground. 
500 points for saving the first Humanoid from a Lander, 1,000 points for saving the second, 1,500 points for the third, and 2,000 points for the fourth and higher. 
500 points for each Humanoid put back into the planet's surface. 
250 points for a Humanoid landing into the ground safely on his own. 

A special undocumented bonus can be gained by dropping off a Humanoid as the last event in a wave. There are two ways to do this. One way requires you to have killed everything off in the wave except for one Lander. Wait for the Lander to pick up a Humanoid. Shoot the Lander and catch the Humanoid JUST before it hits the ground. The other way is to deposit a Humanoid that your ship is carrying at the exact moment when you kill the last enemy of the wave. Either way, when this is done properly the screen will flash several times and you will be awarded 2,000 points. 

Bonus at the end of each wave: 
Wave 1: Humanoids Left X 100. 
Wave 2: Humanoids Left X 200. 
Wave 3: Humanoids Left X 300. 
Wave 4: Humanoids Left X 400. 
Wave 5 and all Yllabian Dogfight waves: 2,500 points. 
Wave 6 and above: Humaniods Left X 500. 
Warp: Humanoids Left X 2,000.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

The enemies that initially appear in each wave are: 
Wave 1: 11 Landers, 2 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers 
Wave 2: 10 Landers, 2 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers, 7 Yllabian Space Guppies 
Wave 3: 10 Landers, 2 Dynamos, 6 Firebombers, 4 Yllabian Space Guppies, 3 Pods 
Wave 4: 17 Landers, 3 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers, 5 Yllabian Space Guppies, 4 Pods 
Wave 5 and every Yllabian Dogfight: 6 Dynamos, 22 Yllabian Space Guppies, 8 Swarmers 
Wave 6: 17 Landers, 3 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers, 5 Yllabian Space Guppies, 4 Pods, 2 Bombers 
Waves 7, 8, and 9: 17 Landers, 3 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers, 5 Yllabian Space Guppies, 4 Pods, 3 Bombers 
Wave 10 and every Firebomber Showdown: 13 Firebombers, 6 Pods 
Wave 11 and every regular wave higher: 18 Landers, 4 Dynamos, 4 Firebombers, 3 Yllabian Space Guppies, 4 Pods, 2 Bombers 

If the planet is destroyed, all Landers are replaced with Mutants. 

* You start the game in the middle of the screen. You can look at your radar to see where the various enemies are. Get to learn the sounds of the game because they are an important clue as to what is going on out of your viewing range. First of all, learn how to use the buttons with proficiency. You don't want to be hunting around for the smart bomb or thrust button when you are in the middle of a firefight. Practice will make you proficient. 

* The player's ship can shoot a maximum of four lasers on the screen at any one time. 

* Learn to use your radar screen and after a while you will only look at the viewable area briefly to take care of business. Each enemy has a unique color on the radar so you should be able to easily identify what they are. In addition, you will also learn how each enemy moves around. This will definitely become a great benefit in the later waves. 

* Listen to the sounds of the game. When you hear a high-pitched chatter, that means a Lander has picked up a Humanoid in order to create a Mutant. Use your radar and look for the green shape going straight up; that's the Lander. Try to get over there as quickly as possible. Just shoot the Lander, not the Humanoid it has taken. When you hear what sound like something being put together, that means a Lander has become a Mutant. 

* Once you shoot the Lander, your job isn't over yet. If the height is too great, the Humanoid will fall and die on impact. You have to fly over the Humanoid and your fighter will pick it up. Any time you scrape against the ground, you will set the Humanoid down. Some players continuously ride around with a Humanoid to prevent the planet from exploding. 

* The planet will only explode when all ten Humanoids are dead. Then you will have to go through waves of nothing but Mutants and the other regular enemies until you make it to a bonus wave. After that, you will have ten humans and a new planet again. Mutants are very dangerous to deal with because they tend to swarm and fire a lot of shots toward your ship. Of course, expert players just shoot all the Humanoids so they can have the challenge of going through these Mutant waves. 

* Try to clear waves as quickly as possible. If you take too long on a wave, a Baiter, Phred, or a Big Red will appear. These enemies are much faster than your fighter and can outrun it. The Baiter also has the tendency to fire pretty accurate shots. One of the tactics to throw them off is to reverse quickly a couple of times. This disorients them briefly and may give you a chance to shoot them. These enemies make their appearance to ensure you finish waves quickly. 

* Use your Smart Bombs only when the screen is crowded with enemies. A lot of players like to get all the Pods together and then touch off a Smart Bomb. Another way is to break open the Pods so that Swarmers are all over then hit the Smart Bomb. 

* Use your Inviso sparingly. A good tactic is to find a lot of enemy units bunched up. Fly fast toward them and at the last second activate your Inviso until you are clear (should amount to less then a second of time). You can destroy quite a few enemies this way and you conserve your Invisio energy. 

* Use Hyperspace only when you are in a totally desperate situation (like getting swarmed by Mutants or Swarmers). Sometimes Hyperspace will destroy your ship on re-entry. 

* Watch out for the Bombers. Although they travel slowly, they leave strings of bombs. If you are not paying attention, you may crash if you attempt to fly through them. 

* The Firebombers have a tendency to shoot a lot of Fireballs at your fighter. Fortunately, you can destroy these Fireballs. This can become complicated if there are four or five Firebombers firing at the same time. The Fireballs don't track your ship. The Firebombers don't start shooting Fireballs until Wave 2. 

* You can fly through and under the terrain (but you cannot exit the screen at the top and come up through the bottom or vice-versa). Use this to your advantage when maneuvering around. 

* Since you 'wrap-around' the screen, this gives you a little more maneuvering room. However, keep looking at your radar because the enemy that disappears off the left side will show up on the right side. Also, shots do not wrap around the edge. 

* In addition to using the 'wrap-around', keep in mind that you can also use the Stargate to your advantage. Some players hang around the Stargate until a Humanoid is abducted. They go through the Stargate, save the Humanoid, and go back to the Stargate again to await the next rescue. Also, the Stargate is useful if you are being pursued by a lot of enemies since it transports you to the opposite side of the planet. 

* Since you get an extra ship, Smart Bomb, and Inviso time every 10,000 points, that should be your constant goal. However, as the waves get higher things move a lot faster, making even getting 10,000 points a challenge. 

* The most extra ships or Smart Bombs that can be obtained is 255. If the player has 255 extra ships or Smart Bombs and then wins an extra one, the counter rolls back to zero. 

* Secret Message: The formula consists of three sequences of buttons, that all must be completed within a quarter of a second of each other, without the player dying onscreen. The moves are as follows... 
1) Joystick Down, Reverse, 1P Start and Thrust. 
2) Reverse, 2P Start and Fire. 
3) Joystick Down, 1P Start, Thrust and Fire. 

* Stargate attack waves 'roll over' at wave 100, which is displayed, when started and after being completed, as Wave 0. The game keeps track of the actual number of waves, even though they are not shown properly. For example, the next wave will be counted as Wave 101, even though it shows being completed as Wave 1. The game will 'roll over' again at Wave 200, which is displayed, when started and after being completed, as Wave 0 as well. The next 'roll over' occurs at Wave 256. Upon completion of Wave 255, the next wave is a wave very similar to the very first wave, except that the Firebombers shoot. This level is counted and displayed as Wave 0, and the player is awarded a bonus of Humanoids left X 0 points (the bonus for this wave is always 0 points). The next is Wave 1, and the game now plays just as if the player had started a new game (warps are now again possible up to Wave 10), except the player gets to keep his score and all of his bonus ships and Smart Bombs.

Vanguard (c) 1981 SNK.

Vanguard is a scrolling space shooter (some levels are horizontal, some are diagonal, and some are vertical). Shoot down enemies with your laser. Keep a close eye on your ever decreasing fuel gauge, luckily each enemy that you destroy will add to your remaining fuel. Find the energy pods to be temporarily invulnerable; the energy pods will also increase your fuel level. At the end of each level you must defeat a boss that is guarded by two moving force fields with holes in them. The computer will announce the name of the each zone using some nifty early 80's synthesized speech.

The different levels include Mountain Zone, Rainbow Zone, Styx Zone, Rainbow Zone 2, Stripe Zone, Rainbow Zone 3, Bleak Zone, and the City of Mystery.

- TRIVIA -

Vanguard was released in July 1981 in Japan and put SNK on the map in North America.

Vanguard is the first color game from SNK and it was one of the first shoot-em-ups with an 8-way directional fire.

The starting music is inspired by the 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' soundtrack (release date is 1979), and later became the theme song to the 1987-1994 television series 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'. 

The music that plays when you get the power-up is 'Vultan's Theme: Attack of the Hawk Men' from the 'Flash Gordon' soundtrack.

A Vanguard unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll &amp; Hyde... Together Again'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your fighter will be at the left side of the screen. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the right side and no slower then the left side. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick back and forth. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control. Here are some strategies for getting through them. There is no break between the areas, but you can pretty much tell what area you are in by the landscape and/or the enemies.

MOUNTAIN ZONE:
This zone is pretty straightforward. The mountain is wide enough for you to maneuver out of harms way.
1) There should be no reason that you can't go through both areas energized. The energy stations are abundant in the mountain zone.
2) The Harley's like to group up in packs of five or six. They will fire on you and an occasional Harley will break from the pack to try to ram your fighter. They usually stay on one level and don't move around a lot. Very easy to evade.
3) The Mist's are a different matter. They move around all over the area and they are rather difficult to hit. You will have to use your lasers from different sides very effectively.

RAINBOW ZONE:
In these zones you will be going diagonal up or diagonal down. The first part only has three aliens while the second part of the zone has six aliens moving up and down.
1) On the diagonal up parts, get your fighter in between the second and third aliens during the first part. Reverse this on the diagonal down parts.
2) On the second part, you will have to get in between the fourth and fifth aliens. You may have to use your top laser to clear out the alien above since the top three alternate with the bottom three. Reverse this on the diagonal down parts.

STYX ZONE:
There are no energy stations in this zone so you will have to do some quick maneuvering and firing in all directions. This area also narrow significantly. Use the same tactics from the Mountain Zone.

STRIPE ZONE:
You only have to deal with ground targets in this zone. This, though, is the problem since those targets are clustered very close together.
1) You should be able to go through this area energized since energy stations are abundant in the lower parts of this zone.
2) If you aren't energized, make sure you decided quickly to go high or low. If you go high, you deal with bases and Garines (bouncing aliens). This can be rough if you mistime it. The bottom has more targets but you must destroy the barrier. You do this by destroying the upper or lower stand that fires it up.
3) This zone lasts a while but the pattern remains the same.

BLEAK ZONE:
You will be going up instead of sideways. The scrolling now is you can't go faster then the top of the screen or slower then the bottom of the screen.
1) Enemies on this screen are actually pretty easy to get through. Just stay in the middle and keep firing. The Romeda may give you trouble since they like to fire left diagonal shots.
2) If you go into the debris left from the Kemlus, a backward 'C' will surround your fighter and you will get 1090 points. You can do this three times. After the third time, if you try this, your fighter will be destroyed.

CITY OF MYSTERY:
This is for all the marbles. There are many hazards to avoid as you try to take out Gond.
1) First, as you enter there are lasers to your left and right. You must quickly get into the second part. Gond is protected by two layers that have openings. These openings line up for only brief moments. Try to take shots through this opening.
2) After a short amount of time, walls will close behind your fighter. You only have a limited amount of time because there are five walls and if they close before you take out Gond, you lose your fighter.
3) The only good thing is if you fail to take out Gond, you advance to the next round. Of course, you don't get the bonus for Gond.
4) After you make it through each set of cave one and cave two, the action gets faster.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Venture (c) 1981 Exidy.

Venture is a 1- or 2-player "Gauntlet" style game (although Venture pre-dates the Atari legend by 4 years) set in a multi-level dungeon. The player, armed with a bow and arrow fights through enemy infested levels in the quest to collect treasure.

Each dungeon is represented as a floor plan, populated with a number of "Space Invader" like monsters. Numerous rooms and their corresponding doors are clearly marked; these rooms are the treasure rooms and each one must be cleared. When the player enters a room, the viewpoint zooms in on the action and the room takes up the whole screen. Each room has a treasure or weapon guarded by one or more creatures. Players must try to retrieve the treasure while avoiding (or killing) creatures and obstacles. Only in the rooms themselves can players use their bow and arrow.

When the treasure is successfully taken out of the chamber, bonus points are awarded. The screen image then returns to the original, zoomed-out floor plan and the player moves on to the next room of their choice. Once a room has been cleared of its item, the player no longer has access to that room. The player must collect all of the treasures on the current level before descending to another dungeon.

- TRIVIA -

Venture was released in June 1981.

Venture came in a white dedicated cabinet and featured sideart of Winky battling green monsters (looks like snakes).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

A) If you wont to change aim without moving, learn just to tap the joystick, not to jam it.

B) When pursued by hall monsters outside the dungeons, don't waste time by shooting them. Reverse direction, switch from side to side, and do whatever else you must to escape.

C) Do your best not to shoot a monster where its corpse might block your path to or from the treasure. If you do, you have no choice but to wait until it has completely disintegrated; under no circumstances should you shoot it again.

D) Because you want to get out of each dungeon quickly, you should waste no time in picking up the treasure. It can and should be done in one fluid motion. The Instant you touch the loot, you should start thinking about getting out.

E) When a hall monster appears outside a dungeon, leave. Even if it is outside the room's only exit, remember that it won't be there when you get outside-although another might.

Once the half monster has actually entered the dungeon, the best policy is to flee in the opposite direction. If there is no exit there or a corpse is blocking it, it is still possible in the first three levels for a skilful Winky to escape around the hall monster. It's a risk but do it if you have to.

F) When leaving a dungeon, look out. You don't want to run straight into a waiting hall monster. The more time you've spent in the level so far, the more you should worry.

G) The question of whether to shoot dungeon monsters when you don't absolutely have to depends on two factors: speed and accuracy. If you think you can kill several in a short time,do it. Keep in mind the bonus at the end of each level, since that determines your final score. Unless you are very fast, there is no point in risking the decrease of your score by a seventh or a sixth for a few hundred points.

H) Since you Start in the same place on the level each time, it makes sense to clear the dungeons nearest you first. If you can make a circuit of the level without being killed,the strategy will save time. If you are killed and have to start over,you will have to take the same long route you avoided before.

I) In The Wall Room, don't bother shooting your way through the red walls. It's a risk that earns you no points and takes more time than simply slipping around them. Since this dungeon Is the easiest, it should probably be saved for last, when you need to finish quickly.

J) In The Serpent Room, send arrows down on the two lower snakes before you enter their territory. Their length will make them easy targets from that angle.

If pressed for time enter and exit the dungeon through the door in the right wail, avoiding a confrontation with the third snake.

K) The Goblin and Skeleton Rooms should be handled according to your inclination. You can easily evade the monsters, but the points you could gain with a few parting shots should be considered.

L) Save The Two-Headed Room for the end of Level Two, since it is a very quick job once you have the secret. When you don't have time to shoot the crabs and then to wait for them to disintegrate from your path, split-second timing alone will get you out safely. The instant you touch the treasure,jam the joystick to the upper left. Each time, you will barely make it past the crabs and out the left head of the room.

A more lucrative and time-consuming method is to stay at the bottom with your treasure and wait for the crabs to drift down from the heads into the body in search of you, as they invariably do. If you shoot well, you can kill them and still leave a clear path out. If a hall monster appears before you finish though, say goodbye to Winky.

M) As soon as you enter The Troll Room, move about an inch to the left of the entrance, staying as low as possible: aim to the upper right. As soon as the walls vanish, one goblin will come thundering down since he doesn't sense that you're aiming at him. Diagonal shots are your best chance against any of the monsters,but the trolls are particularly tricky.

Shoot as soon as he leaves cover, then move up and get the treasure. The remaining troll will not be had to evade If you are fast.

Whenever you do aim vertically or horizontally,the trolls will not give you a chance to hit them, holding you in stalemate until the hall monster shows up. What you must do (if you don't want to shoot diagonally) is aim in some other direction until your target has committed himself to attack. Then quickly shift your aim and fire before he has a chance to dodge.

N) You must kill almost everything in The Dragon Room; there is no room to maneuver around the dragons while they are all alive and moving. Even if you are a skilful archer, you must take special care to shoot so that you still have a clear path to and from the treasure. If you have to wait for the dragons to disintegrate before you can reach it, you might as well forget about it. 

O) The red denizens of The Spider Room win always stay near the treasure in the center; they shift around it to follow you. Shoot one for best results: it takes almost no time and you can easily snatch the treasure from only two defenders.

The instant you do, look out for the two yellow spiders. They will close in on you rapidly,and your only chance is to duck under one and escape while you still have time. Once you reach the door, a couple of arrows shot at your pursuers won't hurt.

P) With each new level, be prepared for greater and greater challenges. Try to view each dungeon creatively to find the best strategy.

VENTURE is one game in which it is not only important but vital to watch more experienced players, observing the game's many unusual problems and the different ways of handling them. Good luck!

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Warlords (c) 1981 Atari.

Atari's Warlords depicts a third-person view of four castles. The player-controlled Warlords and computer-controlled Black Knights use shields to defend their castle walls from the fireballs that ricochet around the playfield. 

Players can capture and catapult the fireballs at opposing castles, using their shield control and 'Power Stone' pushbutton. When a fireball hits a castle wall, it destroys one or more bricks, depending on its speed. 

A castle not paid for is controlled by the computer, with a Black Knight displayed in the appropriate castle. The Black Knights catapult fireballs at the players with increasing accuracy, to provide challenge. 

Game play begins when any start button is pressed and the countdown has ended. The game ends when the last Warlord's castle (containing a crown) has been penetrated by a fireball. At this point a white cloud envelopes the crown, and the latter disappears. 

During the countdown, a dragon flies back and forth across the screen with a fireball in its mouth. At the end of the countdown, a position activated by a Start button has its Black Knight changed to a Warlord's crown. A position not activated remains as a Black Knight and is controlled by the computer. The dragon then spits the fireball from its mouth toward a Warlord's castle. 

The objective is to destroy the three other castles, while protecting one's own castle with the moving shield. The LED pushbuttons have dual functions: in the Ready-to-Play mode they work as Start switches, and during game play they become 'Power Stones' to allow players to capture and catapult fireballs at opponents. 

The spinning fireballs released from a shield have more destructive force on a castle wall than a fireball simply deflected from another wall or the sides of the playfield. However, players will soon find out that they cannot hold onto a fireball for long, since it slowly destroys their own castle walls adjacent to the fireball. 

Additional fireballs appear at predetermined intervals or when a castle is destroyed, whichever comes first. A maximum of four fireballs simultaneously appear on the screen. 

In 1- and 2-player games, the Warlords' crowns will be accompanied by a zero, to begin scoring. The point-scoring system is printed on each control panel (the Black Knights do not score points). 

If a Black Knight has the surviving castle, the game ends. However, if a Warlord has the surviving castle, that player receives bonus points, all castles are rebuilt, and the game continues with a new battle at a higher level. In a 2-player game, both players continue in the game, but only one player can get bonus points. If both Black Knights are eliminated first and only Warlords remain, the level becomes a free-for-all between the two Warlords until one is eliminated. The other Warlord then gets the bonus points, and the game begins again. 

The subsequent levels begin, as mentioned before, with the fireball thrown out by the dragon. In the higher levels, Black Knights play more accurately and faster. 

3- and 4-player games (available in the cocktail version only) are free-for-alls. No scores are kept, and the game ends as soon as there is only one castle left.

Zaxxon (c) 1982 Sega.

Zaxxon is an isometric scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots an armed spaceship and must penetrate heavily-fortified enemy bases, destroying enemy ships and installations before reaching the final confrontation with the game's titular character, a giant armored robot. 

The game consists of three different waves: 

* Floating Fortress: Players must penetrate the fortress's defenses, destroying fuel tanks, gun emplacements, missiles and fighters. An altimeter constantly monitors the player ship's height, necessary to navigate through the walls and electronic barriers that form part of fortress's defenses. The player's ship carries a limited amount of fuel that is constantly depleting and can only be replenished by shooting ground-based enemy fuel tanks. If the ship's fuel runs out, it crashes to the ground and a life is lost.

* Fighter Fleet: This takes place in outer space with the player attacked by waves of enemy fighter planes and rogue satellites. The player ship's fuel does not deplete during this wave.

* Enemy Headquarters: This is similar to the 'Floating Fortress' wave (with fuel depletion once again being an issue), but with the player facing much tougher defenses. Upon completion of this wave, the player enters into battle with Zaxxon himself. The robot fires a fast-moving homing missile that needs to be hit six times before it's destroyed. Upon completion of the third wave, the game starts over with a higher level of difficulty.

BOARD # 834-0211

There were 2 different dedicated cabinets available for Zaxxon, an upright and a cocktail:

* The upright version came in a nice woodgrain cabinet with black and blue sticker-style side art. The marquee is a blue 'Zaxxon' logo with a star filled background. The control panel has a nice 8-Way flight stick with fire buttons on either side, and graphics explaining how to play the game. Finally the upright uses two sets of coin mechs that are of an odd 'skinny' style.

* The cocktail version came in the standard Sega/Gremlin cocktail table (this same table was also used for "Frogger", "Carnival", and several other titles). This was a relatively unadorned machine, the only decorations were a set of instruction cards underneath the glass. This machine had a control panel on either side and used Wico balltop joysticks instead of flight sticks. The coin mechs and start buttons were on the player 1 side only.

All versions used a vertical open frame monitor, and ran the same set of game boards. This game is fully compatible with "Congo Bongo", "Super Zaxxon", and "Future Spy" (those boards will plug right in without modification).

- TRIVIA -

Zaxxon was released in January 1982 in Japan and two months later, in March 1982, in the USA.

At the time of its release, Zaxxon was unique as it was the first game to employ isometric projection, something of a three-quarters viewing perspective. This effect simulated three dimensions (albeit from the viewpoint of a second person).

In the game, Zaxxon is the name of the enemy robot who you must destroy. Milton Bradley turned this and other Sega titles into board games. 'Can You Complete Your Mission Before Zaxxon Zaps You?'.

Vernon Kalanikaus holds the official official record for this game with 4,680,740 points on March 15, 1982.

A Zaxxon unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Jackson".

- UPDATES -

Zaxxon was released in at least 2 versions:
The latest version (set 1 in MAME (zaxxon)) corrects a minor error in the way the original Zaxxon ROM set (set 2 in MAME (zaxxon2)) managed fractions of a credit, seen only when a player earned credit through game play when the game dipswitch settings provided only a fraction of a full credit for each token inserted.

- SCORING -

Gun Implacements (Green and Gray): 200 or 500 points (random)
Fuel Tank: 300 points
Radar Tower: 1,000 points
Missile (Ground-to-Air): 150 points
Missile (Air-to-Air): 200 points
Fighters (on runway): 50 points
Fighters (in air): 100 points + (50 points/level after level 2)
Zaxxon (destroyed with missile in launcher): 1,000 points
Zaxxon (destroying launched missile): 200 points
Destroying all planes in space: 1,000 points
Satellite: 300 points

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* To kill Zaxxon, fly at 2 1/2 units (in other words, with two blocks of your altimeter filled in and one at halfway). Shoot 6 shots at Zaxxon's missile, and you will kill it quickly. If you miss, either dodge the missile, or keep firing and you can still blow up the missile. However, you get less points for hitting the missile while it's in the air.

* Flying at an altitude of 1 1/2 will allow you to hit ground targets while making their shots go harmlessly under you.

* Shoot airplanes on the platform: it will reduce the number you need to kill in the space scene. If you shoot all the airplanes in space you will get a bonus.

* On the levels in outer space, start up the highest point on the upper left and start shooting immediately. You should be able to hit the satellite right away. If you miss, keep moving to the left and keep firing. This works for the second satellite also.

* This is important in later levels because it is possible to run out of fuel in space: if you hit the satellite, you will get some back.

* There are only two levels that repeat. The first air fortress level never gets much harder: use the same pattern for it. On the other levels, only the gaps become narrower.

* Always keep firing! This way you can see if you will make it through the gaps, and you can adjust your height as needed.

* The white canopy only indicates that the enemy plane is at the highest altitude. At any altitude, when an enemy is in your line of fire you will hear a tone and a white X appears in front of your plane. This makes it much easier to grab the 1,000 point bonus for destroying 20 enemy planes, as well as to avoid their shots.

* On later levels you will lose fuel quickly. Make sure you hit as many fuel tanks as possible. If you run out of fuel you will lose a ship.

* OTHERS:
[US] VFD handheld game (1981) released by Coleco: one of the coolest handheld arcade conversion, Coleco's Zaxxon uses a unique combination of mirrors and 2 different VFD displays to get a 3-D affect. Your ship appears to be flying above the surface of the planet and actually flies over walls and other VFD generated images (not possible with just one VFD display). The planet's surface and ground based enemies are created by one VFD, while you and air-based enemies are created by the VFD reflected off a mirror. 
[US] LCD handheld game (1982) released by Bandai: it's a cool double panel LCD game (there are two LCD panels on top of each other). The dual panel creates a kind of 3D effect with lower objects on one panel, and higher ones on the other. Also, all of the background images are created by the LCD and animated. It's quite impressive for an LCD game (and a must have if you love Zaxxon!). 
[US] VFD handheld game (19??) released by Bandai: this game has a unique way of creating a 3-D effect - it only uses 1 VFD display (unlike Coleco's Zaxxon which uses two). The VFD is basically split in two, the upper half you see as the lower part of the playing field, while the lower part of the VFD is reflected on a semi-transparent mirror to create the upper half of the 3-D playing space.. Pretty cool idea to help, and it really works in that all of the ships (not just the players ship like on the Coleco version) have a true depth. It's a little awkward to play sometimes as you have to sit just right to get all of the screen centered perfectly, but once you are in position, it's a very nice version of Zaxxon. It features the planes in space mode, and the flying over land mode. The only thing that seems to be missing is the actual Zaxxon boss at the end...
